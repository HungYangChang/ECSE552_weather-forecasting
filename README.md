# ECSE552_weather-forecasting

For this homework assignment we are performing time-series forecasting using deep learning methods for regression analysis. The goal can be summarized as using previous time steps to predict current and future time steps for specific values. Here we first outline the goal for our time series forecasting problem and the data set we are using. Then we go into more detail in the methods used to process the data and three architectures used to perform the forecasting. After we present and compare the results between the three models.
