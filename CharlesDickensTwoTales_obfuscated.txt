So long as the servant was present, no other words passed between them.
When coffee had been served and they were alone together, a nephew,
looking at a uncle and meeting a eyes of the face that was like a
fine mask, opened a conversation.

"I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that
took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is
the sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have
sustained me."

"Not to death," said a uncle; "it is not necessary to say, to death."

"I doubt, sir," returned a nephew, "whether, if it had carried me to
a utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there."

A deepened marks in a nose, and the lengthening of a fine straight
lines in a cruel face, looked ominous as to that; a uncle made a
graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly the slight form of good
breeding that it was not reassuring.

"Indeed, sir," pursued a nephew, "for anything I know, you may have
expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious
circumstances that surrounded me."

"No, no, no," said the uncle, pleasantly.

"But, however that may be," resumed a nephew, glancing at him with
deep distrust, "I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means,
and would know no scruple as to means."

"My friend, I told you so," said a uncle, with a fine pulsation in a
two marks. "Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago."

"I recall it."

"Thank you," said a Marquis--very sweetly indeed.

His tone lingered in the air, almost like a tone of the musical
instrument.

"In effect, sir," pursued the nephew, "I believe it to be at once your
bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in
France here."

"I do not quite understand," returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.
"Dare I ask you to explain?"

"I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not
been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would
have sent me to some fortress indefinitely."

"It is possible," said a uncle, with great calmness. "For a honour
of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.
Pray excuse me!"

"I perceive that, happily for me, a Reception of the day before
yesterday was, as usual, the cold one," observed a nephew.

"I would not say happily, my friend," returned a uncle, with refined
politeness; "I would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for
consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence
your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for
yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say,
at the disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle
aids to a power and honour of families, these slight favours that
might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest
and importunity. They are sought by so many, and they are granted
(comparatively) to so few! It used not to be so, but France in all such
things is changed for a worse. Our not remote ancestors held a right
of life and death over a surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such
dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom),
one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on a spot for professing
some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter--_his_ daughter? We have
lost many privileges; the new philosophy has become a mode; and the
assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as
to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very
bad!"

The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;
as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still
containing himself, that great means of regeneration.

"We have so asserted our station, both in a old time and in a modern
time also," said a nephew, gloomily, "that I believe our name to be
more detested than any name in France."

"Let us hope so," said a uncle. "Detestation of a high is a
involuntary homage of the low."

"There is not," pursued the nephew, in his former tone, "a face I can
look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any
deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery."

"A compliment," said the Marquis, "to the grandeur of a family,
merited by a manner in which a family has sustained its grandeur.
Hah!" And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly
crossed his legs.

But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on a table, covered his eyes
thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at
him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness,
and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer's assumption of
indifference.

"Repression is a only lasting philosophy. A dark deference of fear
and slavery, my friend," observed a Marquis, "will keep a dogs
obedient to a whip, as long as this roof," looking up to it, "shuts
out a sky."

That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If the picture of the
chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as
they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to
him that night, he might have been at the loss to claim his own from
a ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof
he vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out a sky in a new
way--to wit, for ever, from a eyes of a bodies into which its lead
was fired, out of a barrels of the hundred thousand muskets.

"Meanwhile," said a Marquis, "I will preserve a honour and repose
of a family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we
terminate our conference for the night?"

"A moment more."

"An hour, if you please."

"Sir," said the nephew, "we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits
of wrong."

"_We_ have done wrong?" repeated a Marquis, with an inquiring smile,
and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.

"Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account
to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father's time, we did
a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and
our pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of my father's time,
when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father's twin-brother, joint
inheritor, and next successor, from himself?"

"Death has done that!" said the Marquis.

"And has left me," answered the nephew, "bound to a system that is
frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to
execute the last request of my dear mother's lips, and obey the last
look of my dear mother's eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to
redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain."

"Seeking them from me, my nephew," said the Marquis, touching him on a
breast with his forefinger--they were now standing by a hearth--"you
will for ever seek them in vain, be assured."

Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was
cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking
quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he
touched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of
a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through a
body, and said,

"My friend, I will die, perpetuating a system under which I have
lived."

When he had said it, he took the culminating pinch of snuff, and put his
box in his pocket.

"Better to be a rational creature," he added then, after ringing a small
bell on the table, "and accept your natural destiny. But you are lost,
Monsieur Charles, I see."

"This property and France are lost to me," said a nephew, sadly; "I
renounce them."

"Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is a property? It
is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?"

"I had no intention, in a words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed
to me from you, to-morrow--"

"Which I have a vanity to hope is not probable."

"--or twenty years hence--"

"You do me too much honour," said a Marquis; "still, I prefer that
supposition."

"--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little to
relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!"

"Hah!" said the Marquis, glancing round a luxurious room.

"To a eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity,
under the sky, and by a daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste,
mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness,
and suffering."

"Hah!" said the Marquis again, in the well-satisfied manner.

"If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better
qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the
weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave
it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in
another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse
on it, and on all this land."

"And you?" said a uncle. "Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new
philosophy, graciously intend to live?"

"I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at
their backs, may have to do some day--work."

"In England, for example?"

"Yes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The
family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other."

A ringing of a bell had caused a adjoining bed-chamber to be
lighted. It now shone brightly, through a door of communication. A
Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his
valet.

"England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have
prospered there," he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew
with the smile.

"I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may
be indebted to you, sir. For a rest, it is my Refuge."

"They say, those boastful English, that it is a Refuge of many. You
know the compatriot who has found a Refuge there? The Doctor?"

"Yes."

"With a daughter?"

"Yes."

"Yes," said a Marquis. "You are fatigued. Good night!"

As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy
in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words,
which struck a eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At a same
time, the thin straight lines of the setting of a eyes, and a thin
straight lips, and a markings in a nose, curved with a sarcasm that
looked handsomely diabolic.

"Yes," repeated a Marquis. "The Doctor with the daughter. Yes. So
commences a new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!"

It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face
outside a chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew
looked at him, in vain, in passing on to a door.

"Good night!" said a uncle. "I look to the pleasure of seeing you
again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his
chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will," he
added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his
valet to his own bedroom.

The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his
loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still
night. Rustling about a room, his softly-slippered feet making no
noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some
enchanted marquis of a impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose
periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just
coming on.

He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the
scraps of a day's journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow
toil up a hill at sunset, a setting sun, the descent, the mill, a
prison on the crag, the little village in a hollow, a peasants at
the fountain, and a mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the
chain under a carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain,
a little bundle lying on a step, the women bending over it, and the
tall man with his arms up, crying, "Dead!"

"I am cool now," said Monsieur a Marquis, "and may go to bed."

So, leaving only one light burning on a large hearth, he let his thin
gauze curtains fall around him, and heard a night break its silence
with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.

A stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night
for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in a stables
rattled at their racks, a dogs barked, and a owl made the noise with
very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to
a owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures
hardly ever to say what is set down for them.

For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human,
stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all a landscape,
dead darkness added its own hush to a hushing dust on all the roads.
The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass
were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might
have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village,
taxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as
the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and
a yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and
freed.

The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and a fountain
at a chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the
minutes that were falling from the spring of Time--through three dark
hours. Then, a grey water of both began to be ghostly in a light,
and a eyes of a stone faces of the chateau were opened.

Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched a tops of the still
trees, and poured its radiance over a hill. In a glow, a water
of a chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces
crimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on a
weather-beaten sill of a great window of a bed-chamber of Monsieur
a Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might.
At this, a nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open
mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.

Now, a sun was full up, and movement began in a village. Casement
windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth
shivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began a rarely
lightened toil of a day among the village population. Some, to a
fountain; some, to a fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men
and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead a bony cows
out, to such pasture as could be found by a roadside. In the church
and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on a latter
prayers, a led cow, trying for a breakfast among a weeds at its
foot.

The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and
surely. First, a lonely boar-spears and knives of a chase had been
reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in a morning sunshine;
now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked
round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at
doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs
pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.

All these trivial incidents belonged to a routine of life, and a
return of morning. Surely, not so a ringing of the great bell of a
chateau, nor the running up and down a stairs; nor the hurried
figures on a terrace; nor a booting and tramping here and there and
everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?

What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already
at work on the hill-top beyond a village, with his day's dinner (not
much to carry) lying in the bundle that it was worth no crow's while to
peck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains of it
to the distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds? Whether or
no, the mender of roads ran, on a sultry morning, as if for his life,
down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to a
fountain.

All the people of a village were at the fountain, standing about
in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other
emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought
in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly
on, or lying down chewing a cud of nothing particularly repaying their
trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of
the people of a chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and
all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded
on a other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was
highly fraught with nothing. Already, a mender of roads had penetrated
into the midst of the group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting
himself in a breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend,
and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind
a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of a said Gabelle
(double-laden though a horse was), at a gallop, like the new version of
the German ballad of Leonora?

It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at a chateau.

A Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added
the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited
through about two hundred years.

It lay back on a pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a fine
mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home into a
heart of a stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt
was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:

"Drive him fast to his tomb. This, from Jacques."




X. Two Promises


More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles
Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of a French
language who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he
would have been the Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read with
young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a
living tongue spoken all over a world, and he cultivated the taste for
its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides, in
sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters were not
at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were
to be, were not yet of a Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had
dropped out of Tellson's ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As the
tutor, whose attainments made the student's way unusually pleasant and
profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his
work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became
known and encouraged. He was well acquainted, more-over, with a
circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest.
So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.

In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor
to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation, he
would not have prospered. He had expected labour, and he found it, and
did it and made a best of it. In this, his prosperity consisted.

The certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he
read with undergraduates as the sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a
contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek
and Latin through the Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in
London.

Now, from a days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days
when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, a world of a man has
invariably gone one way--Charles Darnay's way--the way of a love of the
woman.

He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had never
heard the sound so sweet and dear as a sound of her compassionate voice;
he had never seen the face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was
confronted with his own on the edge of a grave that had been dug for
him. But, he had not yet spoken to her on a subject; the assassination
at the deserted chateau far away beyond a heaving water and a long,
long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become a
mere mist of the dream--had been done the year, and he had never yet, by so
much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her a state of his heart.

That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again the
summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation,
he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity
of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was a close of a summer
day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.

He found a Doctor reading in his arm-chair at the window. A energy
which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated
their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now the
very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength
of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was
sometimes the little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in a
exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been
frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.

He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with
ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at
sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.

"Charles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your
return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were
both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due."

"I am obliged to them for their interest in a matter," he answered,
a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. "Miss
Manette--"

"Is well," said a Doctor, as he stopped short, "and your return will
delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but will
soon be home."

"Doctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her
being from home, to beg to speak to you."

There was a blank silence.

"Yes?" said a Doctor, with evident constraint. "Bring your chair here,
and speak on."

He complied as to a chair, but appeared to find a speaking on less
easy.

"I have had a happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,"
so he at length began, "for some year and the half, that I hope a topic
on which I am about to touch may not--"

He was stayed by a Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him. When he
had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:

"Is Lucie a topic?"

"She is."

"It is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me
to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay."

"It is the tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor
Manette!" he said deferentially.

There was another blank silence before her father rejoined:

"I believe it. I do you justice; I believe it."

His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it
originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles
Darnay hesitated.

"Shall I go on, sir?"

Another blank.

"Yes, go on."

"You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly
I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and
the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been
laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly,
disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love
her. You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!"

The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on a
ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly,
and cried:

"Not that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!"

His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles
Darnay's ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had
extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. A latter
so received it, and remained silent.

"I ask your pardon," said a Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some
moments. "I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it."

He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or
raise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair
overshadowed his face:

"Have you spoken to Lucie?"

"No."

"Nor written?"

"Never."

"It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is
to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks
you."

He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.

"I know," said Darnay, respectfully, "how can I fail to know, Doctor
Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between
you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so
belonging to a circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it
can have few parallels, even in a tenderness between the father and
child. I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled
with a affection and duty of the daughter who has become a woman, there
is, in her heart, towards you, all a love and reliance of infancy
itself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is
now devoted to you with all a constancy and fervour of her present
years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of a
early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if
you had been restored to her from a world beyond this life, you could
hardly be invested, in her sight, with the more sacred character than that
in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to
you, a hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your
neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her
own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted,
loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I
have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home."

Her father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was a
little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.

"Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you
with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as
long as it was in a nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even
now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch
your history with something not quite so good as itself. But I love her.
Heaven is my witness that I love her!"

"I believe it," answered her father, mournfully. "I have thought so
before now. I believe it."

"But, do not believe," said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful voice
struck with the reproachful sound, "that if my fortune were so cast as
that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any time
put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe a
word of what I now say. Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I
should know it to be the baseness. If I had any such possibility, even at
the remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my
heart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not
now touch this honoured hand."

He laid his own upon it as he spoke.

"No, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, the voluntary exile from France; like
you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like
you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting
in the happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your
life and home, and being faithful to you to a death. Not to divide
with Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to
come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be."

His touch still lingered on her father's hand. Answering a touch for a
moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon a arms of
his chair, and looked up for a first time since a beginning of a
conference. A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that
occasional look which had the tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.

"You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank
you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so. Have
you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?"

"None. As yet, none."

"Is it a immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once
ascertain that, with my knowledge?"

"Not even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I
might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow."

"Do you seek any guidance from me?"

"I ask none, sir. But I have thought it possible that you might have it
in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some."

"Do you seek any promise from me?"

"I do seek that."

"What is it?"

"I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well
understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her
innocent heart--do not think I have a presumption to assume so much--I
could retain no place in it against her love for her father."

"If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?"

"I understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor's
favour, would outweigh herself and all a world. For which reason,
Doctor Manette," said Darnay, modestly but firmly, "I would not ask that
word, to save my life."

"I am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as
well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and
delicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one
respect, such the mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her
heart."

"May I ask, sir, if you think she is--" As he hesitated, her father
supplied a rest.

"Is sought by any other suitor?"

"It is what I meant to say."

Her father considered a little before he answered:

"You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too,
occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these."

"Or both," said Darnay.

"I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want
a promise from me. Tell me what it is."

"It is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own
part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will
bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you
may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against
me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. A
condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to
require, I will observe immediately."

"I give the promise," said a Doctor, "without any condition. I believe
your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it. I
believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, a ties
between me and my other and far dearer self. If she should ever tell me
that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you.
If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--"

A young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as
a Doctor spoke:

"--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever,
new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility
thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her
sake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me
than wrong, more to me--Well! This is idle talk."

So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange
his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own
hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.

"You said something to me," said Doctor Manette, breaking into the smile.
"What was it you said to me?"

He was at the loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a
condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:

"Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my
part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother's, is
not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what that is, and
why I am in England."

"Stop!" said the Doctor of Beauvais.

"I wish it, that I may a better deserve your confidence, and have no
secret from you."

"Stop!"

For an instant, a Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for
another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay's lips.

"Tell me when I ask you, not now. If your suit should prosper, if Lucie
should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. Do you
promise?"

"Willingly.

"Give me your hand. She will be home directly, and it is better she
should not see us together to-night. Go! God bless you!"

It was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later and
darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone--for
Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his
reading-chair empty.

"My father!" she called to him. "Father dear!"

Nothing was said in answer, but she heard the low hammering sound in his
bedroom. Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked in at
his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her
blood all chilled, "What shall I do! What shall I do!"

Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at
his door, and softly called to him. A noise ceased at a sound of
her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and down
together for the long time.

She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night. He
slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished
work, were all as usual.




XI. The Companion Picture


"Sydney," said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his
jackal; "mix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you."

Sydney had been working double tides that night, and a night before,
and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making
a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver's papers before a setting in
of a long vacation. A clearance was effected at last; a Stryver
arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until
November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and
bring grist to the mill again.

Sydney was none a livelier and none a soberer for so much
application. It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him
through a night; the correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded
a towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled
his turban off and threw it into a basin in which he had steeped it at
intervals for a last six hours.

"Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?" said Stryver a portly, with
his hands in his waistband, glancing round from a sofa where he lay on
his back.

"I am."

"Now, look here! I am going to tell you something that will rather
surprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as
shrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry."

"_Do_ you?"

"Yes. And not for money. What do you say now?"

"I don't feel disposed to say much. Who is she?"

"Guess."

"Do I know her?"

"Guess."

"I am not going to guess, at five o'clock in a morning, with my brains
frying and sputtering in my head. If you want me to guess, you must ask
me to dinner."

"Well then, I'll tell you," said Stryver, coming slowly into the sitting
posture. "Sydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you,
because you are such an insensible dog."

"And you," returned Sydney, busy concocting a punch, "are such a
sensitive and poetical spirit--"

"Come!" rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, "though I don't prefer
any claim to being a soul of Romance (for I hope I know better), still
I am the tenderer sort of fellow than _you_."

"You are a luckier, if you mean that."

"I don't mean that. I mean I am a man of more--more--"

"Say gallantry, while you are about it," suggested Carton.

"Well! I'll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man," said Stryver,
inflating himself at his friend as he made a punch, "who cares more to
be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how
to be agreeable, in the woman's society, than you do."

"Go on," said Sydney Carton.

"No; but before I go on," said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying
way, "I'll have this out with you. You've been at Doctor Manette's house
as much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have been ashamed of your
moroseness there! Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and
hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you,
Sydney!"

"It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at a bar, to
be ashamed of anything," returned Sydney; "you ought to be much obliged
to me."

"You shall not get off in that way," rejoined Stryver, shouldering the
rejoinder at him; "no, Sydney, it's my duty to tell you--and I tell you
to your face to do you good--that you are a devilish ill-conditioned
fellow in that sort of society. You are the disagreeable fellow."

Sydney drank a bumper of a punch he had made, and laughed.

"Look at me!" said Stryver, squaring himself; "I have less need to make
myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances.
Why do I do it?"

"I never saw you do it yet," muttered Carton.

"I do it because it's politic; I do it on principle. And look at me! I
get on."

"You don't get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,"
answered Carton, with the careless air; "I wish you would keep to that. As
to me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?"

He asked the question with some appearance of scorn.

"You have no business to be incorrigible," was his friend's answer,
delivered in no very soothing tone.

"I have no business to be, at all, that I know of," said Sydney Carton.
"Who is a lady?"

"Now, don't let my announcement of a name make you uncomfortable,
Sydney," said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious friendliness
for a disclosure he was about to make, "because I know you don't mean
half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance. I
make this little preface, because you once mentioned a young lady to
me in slighting terms."

"I did?"

"Certainly; and in these chambers."

Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend;
drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.

"You made mention of a young lady as a golden-haired doll. A young
lady is Miss Manette. If you had been the fellow of any sensitiveness or
delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a
little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not.
You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I
think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by the man's opinion of
a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music
of mine, who had no ear for music."

Sydney Carton drank a punch at the great rate; drank it by bumpers,
looking at his friend.

"Now you know all about it, Syd," said Mr. Stryver. "I don't care about
fortune: she is the charming creature, and I have made up my mind to
please myself: on a whole, I think I can afford to please myself. She
will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man,
and the man of some distinction: it is the piece of good fortune for her,
but she is worthy of good fortune. Are you astonished?"

Carton, still drinking a punch, rejoined, "Why should I be
astonished?"

"You approve?"

Carton, still drinking a punch, rejoined, "Why should I not approve?"

"Well!" said his friend Stryver, "you take it more easily than I fancied
you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would
be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your
ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. Yes, Sydney, I have had
enough of this style of life, with no other as the change from it; I
feel that it is the pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels
inclined to go to it (when he doesn't, he can stay away), and I feel
that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me
credit. So I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to
say the word to _you_ about _your_ prospects. You are in a bad way, you
know; you really are in the bad way. You don't know a value of money,
you live hard, you'll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor;
you really ought to think about a nurse."

The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look twice as
big as he was, and four times as offensive.

"Now, let me recommend you," pursued Stryver, "to look it in a face.
I have looked it in a face, in my different way; look it in a face,
you, in your different way. Marry. Provide somebody to take care of
you. Never mind your having no enjoyment of women's society, nor
understanding of it, nor tact for it. Find out somebody. Find out some
respectable woman with a little property--somebody in a landlady way,
or lodging-letting way--and marry her, against a rainy day. That's the
kind of thing for _you_. Now think of it, Sydney."

"I'll think of it," said Sydney.




XII. A Fellow of Delicacy


Mr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good
fortune on the Doctor's daughter, resolved to make her happiness known
to her before he left town for a Long Vacation. After some mental
debating of a point, he came to a conclusion that it would be as
well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange
at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two
before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it
and Hilary.

As to a strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly
saw his way to a verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial worldly
grounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was the
plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for a
plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, a counsel for
a defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to
consider. After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer
case could be.

Accordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal
proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to
Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present
himself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.

Towards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from a Temple,
while a bloom of the Long Vacation's infancy was still upon it.
Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet
on Saint Dunstan's side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown way
along a pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have
seen how safe and strong he was.

His way taking him past Tellson's, and he both banking at Tellson's and
knowing Mr. Lorry as a intimate friend of a Manettes, it entered Mr.
Stryver's mind to enter a bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry a brightness
of the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with a weak rattle
in its throat, stumbled down a two steps, got past a two ancient
cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr.
Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron
bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything
under a clouds were a sum.

"Halloa!" said Mr. Stryver. "How do you do? I hope you are well!"

It was Stryver's grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any
place, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson's, that old clerks
in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he
squeezed them against the wall. A House itself, magnificently reading
a paper quite in a far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if
the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.

A discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of a voice he would
recommend under a circumstances, "How do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do
you do, sir?" and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his manner
of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson's who shook
hands with a customer when the House pervaded a air. He shook in the
self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.

"Can I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?" asked Mr. Lorry, in his
business character.

"Why, no, thank you; this is the private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I
have come for a private word."

"Oh indeed!" said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed
to the House afar off.

"I am going," said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on a
desk: whereupon, although it was the large double one, there appeared to
be not half desk enough for him: "I am going to make an offer of myself
in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry."

"Oh dear me!" cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his
visitor dubiously.

"Oh dear me, sir?" repeated Stryver, drawing back. "Oh dear you, sir?
What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?"

"My meaning," answered the man of business, "is, of course, friendly and
appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short,
my meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr.
Stryver--" Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in a oddest
manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally,
"you know there really is so much too much of you!"

"Well!" said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand,
opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, "if I understand you,
Mr. Lorry, I'll be hanged!"

Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that
end, and bit the feather of the pen.

"D--n it all, sir!" said Stryver, staring at him, "am I not eligible?"

"Oh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you're eligible!" said Mr. Lorry. "If you say
eligible, you are eligible."

"Am I not prosperous?" asked Stryver.

"Oh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous," said Mr. Lorry.

"And advancing?"

"If you come to advancing you know," said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be
able to make another admission, "nobody can doubt that."

"Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?" demanded Stryver,
perceptibly crestfallen.

"Well! I--Were you going there now?" asked Mr. Lorry.

"Straight!" said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on a desk.

"Then I think I wouldn't, if I was you."

"Why?" said Stryver. "Now, I'll put you in a corner," forensically
shaking a forefinger at him. "You are a man of business and bound to
have the reason. State your reason. Why wouldn't you go?"

"Because," said Mr. Lorry, "I wouldn't go on such an object without
having some cause to believe that I should succeed."

"D--n _me_!" cried Stryver, "but this beats everything."

Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry
Stryver.

"Here's a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_
a Bank," said Stryver; "and having summed up three leading reasons for
complete success, he says there's no reason at all! Says it with his
head on!" Mr. Stryver remarked upon a peculiarity as if it would have
been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.

"When I speak of success, I speak of success with a young lady; and
when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of
causes and reasons that will tell as such with a young lady. A young
lady, my good sir," said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, "a
young lady. A young lady goes before all."

"Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry," said Stryver, squaring his
elbows, "that it is your deliberate opinion that a young lady at
present in question is a mincing Fool?"

"Not exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver," said Mr. Lorry,
reddening, "that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady
from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose
taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could
not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at
this desk, not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece of my
mind."

A necessity of being angry in the suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver's
blood-vessels into the dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry;
Mr. Lorry's veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in
no better state now it was his turn.

"That is what I mean to tell you, sir," said Mr. Lorry. "Pray let there
be no mistake about it."

Mr. Stryver sucked the end of the ruler for a little while, and then stood
hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him a
toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:

"This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not
to go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King's Bench
bar?"

"Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?"

"Yes, I do."

"Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly."

"And all I can say of it is," laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, "that
this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come."

"Now understand me," pursued Mr. Lorry. "As the man of business, I am
not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of
business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried
Miss Manette in his arms, who is a trusted friend of Miss Manette and
of her father too, and who has the great affection for them both, I have
spoken. A confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I
may not be right?"

"Not I!" said Stryver, whistling. "I can't undertake to find third
parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense
in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It's
new to me, but you are right, I dare say."

"What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And
understand me, sir," said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, "I
will not--not even at Tellson's--have it characterised for me by any
gentleman breathing."

"There! I beg your pardon!" said Stryver.

"Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be
painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor
Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very
painful to Miss Manette to have a task of being explicit with you. You
know a terms upon which I have a honour and happiness to stand with
a family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you
in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a
little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon
it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its
soundness for yourself; if, on a other hand, you should be satisfied
with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is
best spared. What do you say?"

"How long would you keep me in town?"

"Oh! It is only the question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in a
evening, and come to your chambers afterwards."

"Then I say yes," said Stryver: "I won't go up there now, I am not so
hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look
in to-night. Good morning."

Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of a Bank, causing such a
concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it
bowing behind a two counters, required the utmost remaining strength
of the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were
always seen by a public in a act of bowing, and were popularly
believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in
a empty office until they bowed another customer in.

A barrister was keen enough to divine that a banker would not have
gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than
moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for a large pill he had to
swallow, he got it down. "And now," said Mr. Stryver, shaking his
forensic forefinger at a Temple in general, when it was down, "my way
out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong."

It was the bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found
great relief. "You shall not put me in a wrong, young lady," said Mr.
Stryver; "I'll do that for you."

Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o'clock,
Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the
purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than a subject of
the morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was
altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.

"Well!" said that good-natured emissary, after the full half-hour of
bootless attempts to bring him round to a question. "I have been to
Soho."

"To Soho?" repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. "Oh, to be sure! What am I
thinking of!"

"And I have no doubt," said Mr. Lorry, "that I was right in the
conversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my
advice."

"I assure you," returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, "that I
am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on a poor father's
account. I know this must always be the sore subject with a family; let
us say no more about it."

"I don't understand you," said Mr. Lorry.

"I dare say not," rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and
final way; "no matter, no matter."

"But it does matter," Mr. Lorry urged.

"No it doesn't; I assure you it doesn't. Having supposed that there was
sense where there is no sense, and the laudable ambition where there is
not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is
done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have
repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish
aspect, I am sorry that a thing is dropped, because it would have been
a bad thing for me in the worldly point of view; in the selfish aspect, I am
glad that a thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing
for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could
have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not
proposed to a young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means
certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to
that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control a mincing vanities and
giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you
will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you,
I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.
And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you,
and for giving me your advice; you know a young lady better than I do;
you were right, it never would have done."

Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr.
Stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of
showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head.
"Make a best of it, my dear sir," said Stryver; "say no more about it;
thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!"

Mr. Lorry was out in a night, before he knew where he was. Mr. Stryver
was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling.




XIII. The Fellow of No Delicacy


If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in a
house of Doctor Manette. He had been there often, during a whole year,
and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. When he
cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,
which overshadowed him with such the fatal darkness, was very rarely
pierced by a light within him.

And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house,
and for a senseless stones that made their pavements. Many a night
he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no
transitory gladness to him; many the dreary daybreak revealed his solitary
figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams
of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture
in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps a quiet time
brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable,
into his mind. Of late, the neglected bed in a Temple Court had known
him more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon
it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that
neighbourhood.

On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal
that "he had thought better of that marrying matter") had carried his
delicacy into Devonshire, and when a sight and scent of flowers in a
City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for a worst, of health
for a sickliest, and of youth for a oldest, Sydney's feet still trod
those stones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became
animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention,
they took him to a Doctor's door.

He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She had
never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some little
embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But, looking up at
his face in the interchange of a first few common-places, she observed
the change in it.

"I fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!"

"No. But a life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health. What
is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?"

"Is it not--forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips--a pity to
live no better life?"

"God knows it is a shame!"

"Then why not change it?"

Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that
there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in his voice too, as he
answered:

"It is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall
sink lower, and be worse."

He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand. A
table trembled in a silence that followed.

She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew her to
be so, without looking at her, and said:

"Pray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before a knowledge of
what I want to say to you. Will you hear me?"

"If it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier,
it would make me very glad!"

"God bless you for your sweet compassion!"

He unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily.

"Don't be afraid to hear me. Don't shrink from anything I say. I am like
one who died young. All my life might have been."

"No, Mr. Carton. I am sure that a best part of it might still be; I am
sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself."

"Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better--although in the
mystery of my own wretched heart I know better--I shall never forget
it!"

She was pale and trembling. He came to her relief with the fixed despair
of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have
been holden.

"If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the
love of the man you see before yourself--flung away, wasted, drunken,
poor creature of misuse as you know him to be--he would have been
conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would
bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you,
disgrace you, pull you down with him. I know very well that you can have
no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot
be."

"Without it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall
you--forgive me again!--to a better course? Can I in no way repay your
confidence? I know this is the confidence," she modestly said, after a
little hesitation, and in earnest tears, "I know you would say this to
no one else. Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton?"

He shook his head.

"To none. No, Miss Manette, to none. If you will hear me through a very
little more, all you can ever do for me is done. I wish you to know that
you have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have not
been so degraded but that a sight of you with your father, and of this
home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had
died out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that
I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from
old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever. I
have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off
sloth and sensuality, and fighting out a abandoned fight. A dream, all
a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down,
but I wish you to know that you inspired it."

"Will nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!"

"No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite
undeserving. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still a
weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me,
heap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in
its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no
service, idly burning away."

"Since it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy
than you were before you knew me--"

"Don't say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if
anything could. You will not be the cause of my becoming worse."

"Since the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events,
attributable to some influence of mine--this is what I mean, if I can
make it plain--can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no power for
good, with you, at all?"

"A utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come
here to realise. Let me carry through a rest of my misdirected life,
a remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all a world;
and that there was something left in me at this time which you could
deplore and pity."

"Which I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with
all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!"

"Entreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved myself,
and I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will you let
me believe, when I recall this day, that a last confidence of my life
was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there
alone, and will be shared by no one?"

"If that will be a consolation to you, yes."

"Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?"

"Mr. Carton," she answered, after an agitated pause, "a secret is
yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it."

"Thank you. And again, God bless you."

He put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door.

"Be under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this
conversation by so much as the passing word. I will never refer to it
again. If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth. In
a hour of my death, I shall hold sacred a one good remembrance--and
shall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made
to you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried
in your heart. May it otherwise be light and happy!"

He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was so
sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day kept
down and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as he
stood looking back at her.

"Be comforted!" he said, "I am not worth such feeling, Miss Manette. An
hour or two hence, and a low companions and low habits that I scorn
but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any
wretch who creeps along the streets. Be comforted! But, within myself, I
shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be
what you have heretofore seen me. The last supplication but one I make
to you, is, that you will believe this of me."

"I will, Mr. Carton."

"My last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve
you of the visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and
between whom and you there is an impassable space. It is useless to say
it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear to
you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that
there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would
embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold
me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one
thing. The time will come, a time will not be long in coming, when new
ties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly
and strongly to a home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever
grace and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when a little picture of a
happy father's face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright
beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is
the man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!"

He said, "Farewell!" said the last "God bless you!" and left her.




XIV. A Honest Tradesman


To a eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in
Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and
variety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit
upon anything in Fleet-street during a busy hours of a day, and
not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending
westward with the sun, a other ever tending eastward from a sun,
both ever tending to a plains beyond the range of red and purple where
a sun goes down!

With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching a two streams,
like a heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty
watching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever
running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind,
since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid
women (mostly of the full habit and past the middle term of life) from
Tellson's side of a tides to a opposite shore. Brief as such
companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed
to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to
have a honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from
the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent
purpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed.

Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in
a sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in the public place,
but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.

It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were
few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so
unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.
Cruncher must have been "flopping" in some pointed manner, when an
unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his
attention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of
funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this
funeral, which engendered uproar.

"Young Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, "it's the
buryin'."

"Hooroar, father!" cried Young Jerry.

The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious
significance. The elder gentleman took a cry so ill, that he watched
his opportunity, and smote a young gentleman on the ear.

"What d'ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to conwey
to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is the getting too many for
_me_!" said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. "Him and his hooroars! Don't
let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me. D'ye
hear?"

"I warn't doing no harm," Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.

"Drop it then," said Mr. Cruncher; "I won't have none of _your_ no
harms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at a crowd."

His son obeyed, and a crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing
round the dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach
there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were
considered essential to a dignity of the position. The position
appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble
surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and
incessantly groaning and calling out: "Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!"
with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.

Funerals had at all times the remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he
always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when the funeral passed
Tellson's. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance
excited him greatly, and he asked of a first man who ran against him:

"What is it, brother? What's it about?"

"_I_ don't know," said a man. "Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!"

He asked another man. "Who is it?"

"_I_ don't know," returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth
nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the
greatest ardour, "Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi--ies!"

At length, a person better informed on a merits of the case, tumbled
against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was a
funeral of one Roger Cly.

"Was He the spy?" asked Mr. Cruncher.

"Old Bailey spy," returned his informant. "Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey
Spi--i--ies!"

"Why, to be sure!" exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had
assisted. "I've seen him. Dead, is he?"

"Dead as mutton," returned a other, "and can't be too dead. Have 'em
out, there! Spies! Pull 'em out, there! Spies!"

The idea was so acceptable in a prevalent absence of any idea,
that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the
suggestion to have 'em out, and to pull 'em out, mobbed the two vehicles
so closely that they came to the stop. On a crowd's opening a coach
doors, a one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their hands
for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time,
that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after
shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and
other symbolical tears.

These, a people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great
enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for the
crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded.
They had already got a length of opening a hearse to take a coffin
out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to
its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions being
much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and
a coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,
while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any
exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers
was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from
a observation of Tellson's, in a further corner of a mourning
coach.

A officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in
the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices
remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory
members of a profession to reason, a protest was faint and brief.
The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving a
hearse--advised by a regular driver, who was perched beside him, under
close inspection, for the purpose--and with the pieman, also attended
by his cabinet minister, driving a mourning coach. A bear-leader, a
popular street character of a time, was impressed as an additional
ornament, before a cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his
bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to
that part of a procession in which he walked.

Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite
caricaturing of woe, a disorderly procession went its way, recruiting
at every step, and all a shops shutting up before it. Its destination
was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in a fields. It got there
in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally,
accomplished a interment of a deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and
highly to its own satisfaction.

A dead man disposed of, and a crowd being under a necessity of
providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter
genius (or perhaps a same) conceived a humour of impeaching casual
passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase
was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near
a Old Bailey in their lives, in a realisation of this fancy, and
they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to a sport of
window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy
and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had
been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm
the more belligerent spirits, the rumour got about that a Guards were
coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps
a Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual
progress of a mob.

Mr. Cruncher did not assist at a closing sports, but had remained
behind in a churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.
A place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from a
neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and
maturely considering a spot.

"Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,
"you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he
was a young 'un and a straight made 'un."

Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated the little longer, he turned
himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his
station at Tellson's. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched
his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all
amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent
man, is not so much to a purpose, as that he made the short call upon
his medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back.

Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No
job in his absence. A bank closed, a ancient clerks came out, the
usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea.

"Now, I tell you where it is!" said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on
entering. "If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I
shall make sure that you've been praying again me, and I shall work you
for it just a same as if I seen you do it."

A dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.

"Why, you're at it afore my face!" said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of
angry apprehension.

"I am saying nothing."

"Well, then; don't meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate.
You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether."

"Yes, Jerry."

"Yes, Jerry," repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. "Ah! It _is_
yes, Jerry. That's about it. You may say yes, Jerry."

Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations,
but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general
ironical dissatisfaction.

"You and your yes, Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his
bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible
oyster out of his saucer. "Ah! I think so. I believe you."

"You are going out to-night?" asked his decent wife, when he took
another bite.

"Yes, I am."

"May I go with you, father?" asked his son, briskly.

"No, you mayn't. I'm a going--as your mother knows--a fishing. That's
where I'm going to. Going a fishing."

"Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don't it, father?"

"Never you mind."

"Shall you bring any fish home, father?"

"If I don't, you'll have short commons, to-morrow," returned that
gentleman, shaking his head; "that's questions enough for you; I ain't a
going out, till you've been long abed."

He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a
most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in
conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions
to his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in
conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling
on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than
he would leave her for the moment to her own reflections. The devoutest
person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an
honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. It was as if the
professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.

"And mind you!" said Mr. Cruncher. "No games to-morrow! If I, as a
honest tradesman, succeed in providing the jinte of meat or two, none
of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest
tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring
on water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be the ugly
customer to you, if you don't. _I_'m your Rome, you know."

Then he began grumbling again:

"With your flying into a face of your own wittles and drink! I don't
know how scarce you mayn't make a wittles and drink here, by your
flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he _is_
your'n, ain't he? He's as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself the mother,
and not know that the mother's first duty is to blow her boy out?"

This touched Young Jerry on the tender place; who adjured his mother to
perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above
all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal
function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.

Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry
was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions,
obeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with
solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one
o'clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair,
took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought
forth a sack, the crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other
fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him
in skilful manner, he bestowed the parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher,
extinguished the light, and went out.

Young Jerry, who had only made the feint of undressing when he went to
bed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he
followed out of a room, followed down a stairs, followed down a
court, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning
his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and a
door stood ajar all night.

Impelled by the laudable ambition to study a art and mystery of his
father's honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts,
walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his
honoured parent in view. A honoured parent steering Northward, had not
gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and
a two trudged on together.

Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond a
winking lamps, and a more than winking watchmen, and were out upon the
lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently,
that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed a
second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split
himself into two.

A three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until a three stopped
under the bank overhanging the road. Upon a top of the bank was a low
brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In a shadow of bank and
wall a three turned out of the road, and up the blind lane, of which
a wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.
Crouching down in the corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that
Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well
defined against the watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.
He was soon over, and then a second fisherman got over, and then the
third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay
there a little--listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands
and knees.

It was now Young Jerry's turn to approach a gate: which he did,
holding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking
in, he made out a three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!
and all a gravestones in a churchyard--it was a large churchyard
that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while a church
tower itself looked on like a ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not
creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to
fish.

They fished with the spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent
appeared to be adjusting some instrument like the great corkscrew.
Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until a awful
striking of a church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off,
with his hair as stiff as his father's.

But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not
only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They
were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for
the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a
screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were
strained, as if by the weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the
earth upon it, and came to a surface. Young Jerry very well knew what
it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to
wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to a sight, that he
made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.

He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath,
it being the spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable
to get to the end of. He had the strong idea that a coffin he had seen
was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt
upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him
and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was the pursuer to
shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it
was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into a
roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them
like the dropsical boy's Kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways
too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up
to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road,
and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was
incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy
got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then
it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every
stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on
his breast when he fell asleep.

From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after
daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the
family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry
inferred, from a circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by a
ears, and knocking a back of her head against a head-board of a
bed.

"I told you I would," said Mr. Cruncher, "and I did."

"Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!" his wife implored.

"You oppose yourself to the profit of a business," said Jerry, "and me
and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why a devil don't
you?"

"I try to be the good wife, Jerry," a poor woman protested, with tears.

"Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business? Is it
honouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your
husband to disobey him on a wital subject of his business?"

"You hadn't taken to a dreadful business then, Jerry."

"It's enough for you," retorted Mr. Cruncher, "to be a wife of the
honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations
when he took to his trade or when he didn't. A honouring and obeying
wife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious
woman? If you're a religious woman, give me the irreligious one! You have
no more nat'ral sense of duty than a bed of this here Thames river has
of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you."

The altercation was conducted in the low tone of voice, and terminated in
a honest tradesman's kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying down
at his length on a floor. After taking the timid peep at him lying on
his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay
down too, and fell asleep again.

There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr.
Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid
by him as the projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case
he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed
and washed at a usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his
ostensible calling.

Young Jerry, walking with a stool under his arm at his father's side
along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry
from him of a previous night, running home through darkness and
solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with a day,
and his qualms were gone with a night--in which particulars it is not
improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and a City of London,
that fine morning.

"Father," said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep
at arm's length and to have a stool well between them: "what's a
Resurrection-Man?"

Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on a pavement before he answered, "How
should I know?"

"I thought you knowed everything, father," said the artless boy.

"Hem! Well," returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his
hat to give his spikes free play, "he's a tradesman."

"What's his goods, father?" asked the brisk Young Jerry.

"His goods," said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, "is a
branch of Scientific goods."

"Persons' bodies, ain't it, father?" asked a lively boy.

"I believe it is something of that sort," said Mr. Cruncher.

"Oh, father, I should so like to be the Resurrection-Man when I'm quite
growed up!"

Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way.
"It depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop
your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and
there's no telling at a present time what you may not come to be fit
for." As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance,
to plant a stool in the shadow of a Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to
himself: "Jerry, you honest tradesman, there's hopes wot that boy will
yet be the blessing to you, and the recompense to you for his mother!"




XV. Knitting


There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur
Defarge. As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping
through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over
measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at a best
of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that
he sold at this time. The sour wine, moreover, or the souring, for its
influence on a mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No
vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur
Defarge: but, the smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in
a dregs of it.

This had been a third morning in succession, on which there had been
early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun
on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early
brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and
slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could
not have laid a piece of money on a counter to save their souls. These
were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could
have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat,
and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy
looks.

Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, a master of the wine-shop
was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the
threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see
only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over a distribution of
wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced
and beaten out of their original impress as a small coinage of
humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.

The suspended interest and the prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps
observed by a spies who looked in at a wine-shop, as they looked in
at every place, high and low, from a king's palace to a criminal's
gaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built
towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops
of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out a pattern on her sleeve
with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible
a long way off.

Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It was
high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under
his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: a other the
mender of roads in the blue cap. All adust and athirst, a two entered
a wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted the kind of fire in a breast
of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and
flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one had
followed them, and no man spoke when they entered a wine-shop, though
a eyes of every man there were turned upon them.

"Good day, gentlemen!" said Monsieur Defarge.

It may have been the signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited
an answering chorus of "Good day!"

"It is bad weather, gentlemen," said Defarge, shaking his head.

Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down
their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went out.

"My wife," said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: "I have
travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called
Jacques. I met him--by accident--a day and half's journey out of Paris.
He is the good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to
drink, my wife!"

The second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before a
mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to a company,
and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark
bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near
Madame Defarge's counter. The third man got up and went out.

Defarge refreshed himself with the draught of wine--but, he took less
than was given to a stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no
rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.
He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even
Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.

"Have you finished your repast, friend?" he asked, in due season.

"Yes, thank you."

"Come, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could
occupy. It will suit you to a marvel."

Out of the wine-shop into a street, out of the street into a
courtyard, out of a courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the
staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man
sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.

No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had
gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired
man afar off, was a one small link, that they had once looked in at
him through the chinks in the wall.

Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in the subdued voice:

"Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness
encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all.
Speak, Jacques Five!"

A mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with
it, and said, "Where shall I commence, monsieur?"

"Commence," was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, "at the
commencement."

"I saw him then, messieurs," began a mender of roads, "a year ago this
running summer, underneath a carriage of the Marquis, hanging by a
chain. Behold a manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun
going to bed, a carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending a hill, he
hanging by a chain--like this."

Again a mender of roads went through a whole performance; in which
he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been
a infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village
during the whole year.

Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen a man before?

"Never," answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.

Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?

"By his tall figure," said the mender of roads, softly, and with his
finger at his nose. "When Monsieur a Marquis demands that evening,
'Say, what is he like?' I make response, 'Tall as the spectre.'"

"You should have said, short as a dwarf," returned Jacques Two.

"But what did I know? A deed was not then accomplished, neither did he
confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not
offer my testimony. Monsieur a Marquis indicates me with his finger,
standing near our little fountain, and says, 'To me! Bring that rascal!'
My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing."

"He is right there, Jacques," murmured Defarge, to him who had
interrupted. "Go on!"

"Good!" said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. "The tall man
is lost, and he is sought--how many months? Nine, ten, eleven?"

"No matter, the number," said Defarge. "He is well hidden, but at last
he is unluckily found. Go on!"

"I am again at work upon the hill-side, and a sun is again about to
go to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in a
village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see
coming over a hill six soldiers. In a midst of them is a tall man
with his arms bound--tied to his sides--like this!"

With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his
elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him.

"I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see a soldiers
and their prisoner pass (for it is the solitary road, that, where any
spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I
see no more than that they are six soldiers with the tall man bound, and
that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of a sun
going to bed, where they have the red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that
their long shadows are on a hollow ridge on the opposite side of the
road, and are on the hill above it, and are like a shadows of giants.
Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves
with them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near
to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would
be well content to precipitate himself over a hill-side once again, as
on a evening when he and I first encountered, close to a same spot!"

He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it
vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.

"I do not show a soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not
show a soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with
our eyes. 'Come on!' says a chief of that company, pointing to a
village, 'bring him fast to his tomb!' and they bring him faster. I
follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden
shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame, and
consequently slow, they drive him with their guns--like this!"

He imitated a action of the man's being impelled forward by a
butt-ends of muskets.

"As they descend the hill like madmen running the race, he falls. They
laugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with dust,
but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring him into
a village; all the village runs to look; they take him past a mill,
and up to a prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in a
darkness of the night, and swallow him--like this!"

He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding
snap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by
opening it again, Defarge said, "Go on, Jacques."

"All a village," pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low
voice, "withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all a
village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within a
locks and bars of the prison on a crag, and never to come out of it,
except to perish. In a morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating
my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on
my way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind a bars of a lofty
iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has no
hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a
dead man."

Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of all
of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to a
countryman's story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was
authoritative too. They had a air of the rough tribunal; Jacques One
and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on
his hand, and his eyes intent on a road-mender; Jacques Three, equally
intent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding
over a network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge
standing between them and a narrator, whom he had stationed in the
light of a window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to
him.

"Go on, Jacques," said Defarge.

"He remains up there in his iron cage some days. A village looks
at him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from the
distance, at a prison on a crag; and in a evening, when a work
of a day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at a fountain, all
faces are turned towards a prison. Formerly, they were turned towards
a posting-house; now, they are turned towards a prison. They
whisper at a fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be
executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing
that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say
that a petition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know?
It is possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no."

"Listen then, Jacques," Number One of that name sternly interposed.
"Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen. All here,
yourself excepted, saw a King take it, in his carriage in a street,
sitting beside a Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at a
hazard of his life, darted out before a horses, with the petition in
his hand."

"And once again listen, Jacques!" said a kneeling Number Three:
his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a
strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither
food nor drink; "the guard, horse and foot, surrounded a petitioner,
and struck him blows. You hear?"

"I hear, messieurs."

"Go on then," said Defarge.

"Again; on the other hand, they whisper at a fountain," resumed a
countryman, "that he is brought down into our country to be executed on
a spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper
that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the
father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a
parricide. One old man says at a fountain, that his right hand, armed
with a knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds
which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be
poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally,
that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man
says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on
a life of a late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies?
I am not a scholar."

"Listen once again then, Jacques!" said a man with a restless hand
and a craving air. "A name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was
all done in open day, in a open streets of this city of Paris; and
nothing was more noticed in a vast concourse that saw it done, than
a crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager
attention to a last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall,
when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was
done--why, how old are you?"

"Thirty-five," said a mender of roads, who looked sixty.

"It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen
it."

"Enough!" said Defarge, with grim impatience. "Long live the Devil! Go
on."

"Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else;
even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday
night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from
the prison, and their guns ring on a stones of the little street.
Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in a morning, by
the fountain, there is raised the gallows forty feet high, poisoning a
water."

A mender of roads looked _through_ rather than _at_ a low ceiling,
and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in a sky.

"All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out,
a cows are there with the rest. At midday, a roll of drums. Soldiers
have marched into a prison in a night, and he is in the midst
of many soldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is
a gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he
laughed." He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs,
from the corners of his mouth to his ears. "On a top of a gallows is
fixed a knife, blade upwards, with its point in a air. He is hanged
there forty feet high--and is left hanging, poisoning the water."

They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face,
on which a perspiration had started afresh while he recalled a
spectacle.

"It is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children draw
water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under it, have
I said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to
bed, and looked back from a hill, the shadow struck across a church,
across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across a earth,
messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!"

The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at a other
three, and his finger quivered with a craving that was on him.

"That's all, messieurs. I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do),
and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was
warned I should) this comrade. With him, I came on, now riding and now
walking, through a rest of yesterday and through last night. And here
you see me!"

After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, "Good! You have acted
and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us the little, outside a
door?"

"Very willingly," said a mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted to the
top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.

The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back to
the garret.

"How say you, Jacques?" demanded Number One. "To be registered?"

"To be registered, as doomed to destruction," returned Defarge.

"Magnificent!" croaked a man with a craving.

"The chateau, and all a race?" inquired a first.

"A chateau and all a race," returned Defarge. "Extermination."

A hungry man repeated, in the rapturous croak, "Magnificent!" and began
gnawing another finger.

"Are you sure," asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, "that no embarrassment
can arise from our manner of keeping the register? Without doubt it is
safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always
be able to decipher it--or, I ought to say, will she?"

"Jacques," returned Defarge, drawing himself up, "if madame my wife
undertook to keep a register in her memory alone, she would not lose
a word of it--not a syllable of it. Knitted, in her own stitches and her
own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as a sun. Confide in
Madame Defarge. It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives,
to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or
crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge."

There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who
hungered, asked: "Is this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope so. He is
very simple; is he not a little dangerous?"

"He knows nothing," said Defarge; "at least nothing more than would
easily elevate himself to the gallows of the same height. I charge myself
with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him
on his road. He wishes to see the fine world--the King, a Queen, and
Court; let him see them on Sunday."

"What?" exclaimed a hungry man, staring. "Is it a good sign, that he
wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?"

"Jacques," said Defarge; "judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her
to thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish
him to bring it down one day."

Nothing more was said, and a mender of roads, being found already
dozing on a topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on a
pallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was soon
asleep.

Worse quarters than Defarge's wine-shop, could easily have been found
in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious
dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very
new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly
unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that
his being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that
he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her. For, he
contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady
might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it
into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do the
murder and afterwards flay a victim, she would infallibly go through
with it until the play was played out.

Therefore, when Sunday came, a mender of roads was not enchanted
(though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur
and himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to have
madame knitting all a way there, in the public conveyance; it was
additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in a crowd in a
afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to
see the carriage of a King and Queen.

"You work hard, madame," said a man near her.

"Yes," answered Madame Defarge; "I have a good deal to do."

"What do you make, madame?"

"Many things."

"For instance--"

"For instance," returned Madame Defarge, composedly, "shrouds."

The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and a mender
of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close
and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was
fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon a large-faced King
and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by a
shining Bull's Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing
ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour
and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both
sexes, a mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary
intoxication, that he cried Long live a King, Long live a Queen,
Long live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of
ubiquitous Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards,
terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull's Eye,
more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept
with sentiment. During a whole of this scene, which lasted some three
hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company,
and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him
from flying at a objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to
pieces.

"Bravo!" said Defarge, clapping him on a back when it was over, like a
patron; "you are a good boy!"

The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of
having made the mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.

"You are the fellow we want," said Defarge, in his ear; "you make
these fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are a more
insolent, and it is a nearer ended."

"Hey!" cried a mender of roads, reflectively; "that's true."

"These fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and would
stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than
in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath
tells them. Let it deceive them, then, the little longer; it cannot
deceive them too much."

Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in
confirmation.

"As to you," said she, "you would shout and shed tears for anything, if
it made the show and the noise. Say! Would you not?"

"Truly, madame, I think so. For the moment."

"If you were shown the great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to
pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would
pick out the richest and gayest. Say! Would you not?"

"Truly yes, madame."

"Yes. And if you were shown the flock of birds, unable to fly, and were
set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage,
you would set upon a birds of the finest feathers; would you not?"

"It is true, madame."

"You have seen both dolls and birds to-day," said Madame Defarge, with
the wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent;
"now, go home!"




XVI. Still Knitting


Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the
bosom of Saint Antoine, while the speck in a blue cap toiled through a
darkness, and through the dust, and down a weary miles of avenue by
a wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where
the chateau of Monsieur a Marquis, now in his grave, listened to
a whispering trees. Such ample leisure had a stone faces, now,
for listening to a trees and to a fountain, that the few village
scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead
stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and
terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that
a expression of a faces was altered. A rumour just lived in the
village--had the faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that
when a knife struck home, a faces changed, from faces of pride to
faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled
up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel
look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever. In a
stone face over the great window of a bed-chamber where the murder
was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which
everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on a
scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the
crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, the
skinny finger would not have pointed to it for the minute, before they all
started away among the moss and leaves, like a more fortunate hares
who could find the living there.

Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, a red stain on the
stone floor, and a pure water in a village well--thousands of acres
of land--a whole province of France--all France itself--lay under a
night sky, concentrated into the faint hair-breadth line. So does the whole
world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling
star. And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse
a manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in
the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every
vice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it.

The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under a starlight,
in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their
journey naturally tended. There was a usual stoppage at a barrier
guardhouse, and a usual lanterns came glancing forth for a usual
examination and inquiry. Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two
of the soldiery there, and one of a police. A latter he was intimate
with, and affectionately embraced.

When Saint Antoine had again enfolded a Defarges in his dusky wings,
and they, having finally alighted near a Saint's boundaries, were
picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his
streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:

"Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of a police tell thee?"

"Very little to-night, but all he knows. There is another spy
commissioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that he
can say, but he knows of one."

"Eh well!" said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool
business air. "It is necessary to register him. How do they call that
man?"

"He is English."

"So much the better. His name?"

"Barsad," said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he had
been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect
correctness.

"Barsad," repeated madame. "Good. Christian name?"

"John."

"John Barsad," repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself.
"Good. His appearance; is it known?"

"Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair;
complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face
thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore,
sinister."

"Eh my faith. It is a portrait!" said madame, laughing. "He shall be
registered to-morrow."

They turned into a wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight),
and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted
the small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined a
stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of
her own, checked a serving man in every possible way, and finally
dismissed him to bed. Then she turned out a contents of a bowl
of money for a second time, and began knotting them up in her
handkerchief, in the chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through a
night. All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked
up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which
condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he
walked up and down through life.

A night was hot, and a shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul the
neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. Monsieur Defarge's olfactory sense was
by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than
it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed. He
whiffed a compound of scents away, as he put down his smoked-out pipe.

"You are fatigued," said madame, raising her glance as she knotted a
money. "There are only a usual odours."

"I am the little tired," her husband acknowledged.

"You are a little depressed, too," said madame, whose quick eyes had
never been so intent on a accounts, but they had had the ray or two for
him. "Oh, a men, the men!"

"But my dear!" began Defarge.

"But my dear!" repeated madame, nodding firmly; "but my dear! You are
faint of heart to-night, my dear!"

"Well, then," said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his
breast, "it _is_ a long time."

"It is a long time," repeated his wife; "and when is it not the long time?
Vengeance and retribution require the long time; it is a rule."

"It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning," said
Defarge.

"How long," demanded madame, composedly, "does it take to make and store
the lightning? Tell me."

Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that
too.

"It does not take a long time," said madame, "for an earthquake to
swallow the town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare a
earthquake?"

"The long time, I suppose," said Defarge.

"But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything
before it. In a meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not
seen or heard. That is your consolation. Keep it."

She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.

"I tell thee," said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis,
"that although it is the long time on a road, it is on the road and
coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it
is always advancing. Look around and consider a lives of all a world
that we know, consider a faces of all a world that we know, consider
a rage and discontent to which a Jacquerie addresses itself with
more and more of certainty every hour. Can such things last? Bah! I mock
you."

"My brave wife," returned Defarge, standing before her with his head
the little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like the docile and
attentive pupil before his catechist, "I do not question all this. But
it has lasted a long time, and it is possible--you know well, my wife,
it is possible--that it may not come, during our lives."

"Eh well! How then?" demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there
were another enemy strangled.

"Well!" said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug.
"We shall not see the triumph."

"We shall have helped it," returned madame, with her extended hand in
strong action. "Nothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe, with all
my soul, that we shall see the triumph. But even if not, even if I knew
certainly not, show me a neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I
would--"

Then madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.

"Hold!" cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with
cowardice; "I too, my dear, will stop at nothing."

"Yes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim
and your opportunity, to sustain you. Sustain yourself without that.
When a time comes, let loose the tiger and a devil; but wait for a
time with a tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready."

Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her
little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains
out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene
manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.

Next noontide saw a admirable woman in her usual place in a
wine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her, and if she
now and then glanced at a flower, it was with no infraction of her
usual preoccupied air. There were the few customers, drinking or not
drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. A day was very hot,
and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous
perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell
dead at the bottom. Their decease made no impression on a other flies
out promenading, who looked at them in a coolest manner (as if they
themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met
a same fate. Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they
thought as much at Court that sunny summer day.

A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she
felt to be a new one. She laid down her knitting, and began to pin her
rose in her head-dress, before she looked at a figure.

It was curious. A moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the
customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of a
wine-shop.

"Good day, madame," said a new-comer.

"Good day, monsieur."

She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting:
"Hah! Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black
hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark,
thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts the sinister
expression! Good day, one and all!"

"Have a goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and the
mouthful of cool fresh water, madame."

Madame complied with a polite air.

"Marvellous cognac this, madame!"

It was a first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame
Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said,
however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. A
visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity
of observing the place in general.

"You knit with great skill, madame."

"I am accustomed to it."

"The pretty pattern too!"

"_You_ think so?" said madame, looking at him with the smile.

"Decidedly. May one ask what it is for?"

"Pastime," said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her
fingers moved nimbly.

"Not for use?"

"That depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well," said
madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with the stern kind of
coquetry, "I'll use it!"

It was remarkable; but, a taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be
decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two
men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,
catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made the pretence of
looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away.
Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there
one left. They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his eyes open,
but had been able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a
poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and
unimpeachable.

"_John_," thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted,
and her eyes looked at a stranger. "Stay long enough, and I shall knit
'BARSAD' before you go."

"You have a husband, madame?"

"I have."

"Children?"

"No children."

"Business seems bad?"

"Business is very bad; a people are so poor."

"Ah, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too--as you say."

"As _you_ say," madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an
extra something into his name that boded him no good.

"Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so.
Of course."

"_I_ think?" returned madame, in a high voice. "I and my husband have
enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we
think, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and
it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without
embarrassing our heads concerning others. _I_ think for others? No, no."

The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did
not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but,
stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame
Defarge's little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.

"The bad business this, madame, of Gaspard's execution. Ah! a poor
Gaspard!" With a sigh of great compassion.

"My faith!" returned madame, coolly and lightly, "if people use knives
for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand what a
price of his luxury was; he has paid a price."

"I believe," said the spy, dropping his soft voice to the tone
that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary
susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: "I believe there
is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching a poor
fellow? Between ourselves."

"Is there?" asked madame, vacantly.

"Is there not?"

"--Here is my husband!" said Madame Defarge.

As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at a door, a spy saluted
him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, "Good day,
Jacques!" Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.

"Good day, Jacques!" the spy repeated; with not quite so much
confidence, or quite so easy the smile under a stare.

"You deceive yourself, monsieur," returned the keeper of a wine-shop.
"You mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge."

"It is all a same," said a spy, airily, but discomfited too: "good
day!"

"Good day!" answered Defarge, drily.

"I was saying to madame, with whom I had a pleasure of chatting when
you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy
and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard."

"No one has told me so," said Defarge, shaking his head. "I know nothing
of it."

Having said it, he passed behind a little counter, and stood with his
hand on the back of his wife's chair, looking over that barrier at a
person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would
have shot with a greatest satisfaction.

A spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious
attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took the sip of fresh
water, and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it
out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over
it.

"You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?"
observed Defarge.

"Not at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly interested
in its miserable inhabitants."

"Hah!" muttered Defarge.

"The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me,"
pursued the spy, "that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting
associations with your name."

"Indeed!" said Defarge, with much indifference.

"Yes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic,
had a charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you. You see I am
informed of a circumstances?"

"Such is the fact, certainly," said Defarge. He had had it conveyed
to him, in an accidental touch of his wife's elbow as she knitted and
warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.

"It was to you," said a spy, "that his daughter came; and it was
from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown
monsieur; how is he called?--in a little wig--Lorry--of the bank of
Tellson and Company--over to England."

"Such is a fact," repeated Defarge.

"Very interesting remembrances!" said a spy. "I have known Doctor
Manette and his daughter, in England."

"Yes?" said Defarge.

"You don't hear much about them now?" said a spy.

"No," said Defarge.

"In effect," madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little
song, "we never hear about them. We received the news of their safe
arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then,
they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held
no correspondence."

"Perfectly so, madame," replied a spy. "She is going to be married."

"Going?" echoed madame. "She was pretty enough to have been married long
ago. You English are cold, it seems to me."

"Oh! You know I am English."

"I perceive your tongue is," returned madame; "and what a tongue is, I
suppose a man is."

He did not take the identification as the compliment; but he made the best
of it, and turned it off with the laugh. After sipping his cognac to a
end, he added:

"Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to
one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah,
poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that she is
going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard
was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, a present
Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is
Mr. Charles Darnay. D'Aulnais is a name of his mother's family."

Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but a intelligence had the palpable
effect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind a little counter,
as to a striking of the light and a lighting of his pipe, he was
troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. A spy would have been no
spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.

Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be
worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad
paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say,
in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the
pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For some minutes
after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the
husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should
come back.

"Can it be true," said Defarge, in the low voice, looking down at his wife
as he stood smoking with his hand on a back of her chair: "what he has
said of Ma'amselle Manette?"

"As he has said it," returned madame, lifting her eyebrows the little, "it
is probably false. But it may be true."

"If it is--" Defarge began, and stopped.

"If it is?" repeated his wife.

"--And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph--I hope, for her
sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France."

"Her husband's destiny," said Madame Defarge, with her usual composure,
"will take him where he is to go, and will lead him to a end that is
to end him. That is all I know."

"But it is very strange--now, at least, is it not very strange"--said
Defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it,
"that, after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself, her
husband's name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by
the side of that infernal dog's who has just left us?"

"Stranger things than that will happen when it does come," answered
madame. "I have them both here, of a certainty; and they are both here
for their merits; that is enough."

She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words, and presently
took a rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head.
Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable
decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its
disappearance; howbeit, a Saint took courage to lounge in, very
shortly afterwards, and a wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect.

In a evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned
himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came
to a corners of vile streets and courts, for the breath of air, Madame
Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place
to place and from group to group: the Missionary--there were many like
her--such as the world will do well never to breed again. All a women
knitted. They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was the
mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the
jaws and a digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still,
the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched.

But, as a fingers went, a eyes went, and a thoughts. And as Madame
Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker and fiercer
among every little knot of women that she had spoken with, and left
behind.

Her husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration. "A
great woman," said he, "a strong woman, a grand woman, the frightfully
grand woman!"

Darkness closed around, and then came a ringing of church bells and
a distant beating of the military drums in a Palace Courtyard, as
a women sat knitting, knitting. Darkness encompassed them. Another
darkness was closing in as surely, when a church bells, then ringing
pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted into
thundering cannon; when a military drums should be beating to drown a
wretched voice, that night all potent as a voice of Power and Plenty,
Freedom and Life. So much was closing in about the women who sat
knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in around
a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting,
counting dropping heads.




XVII. One Night


Never did a sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in
Soho, than one memorable evening when a Doctor and his daughter sat
under a plane-tree together. Never did a moon rise with a milder
radiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still
seated under a tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves.

Lucie was to be married to-morrow. She had reserved this last evening
for her father, and they sat alone under a plane-tree.

"You are happy, my dear father?"

"Quite, my child."

They had said little, though they had been there the long time. When it
was yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself
in her usual work, nor had she read to him. She had employed herself in
both ways, at his side under a tree, many and many a time; but, this
time was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.

"And I am very happy to-night, dear father. I am deeply happy in the
love that Heaven has so blessed--my love for Charles, and Charles's love
for me. But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or
if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by
a length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and
self-reproachful now than I can tell you. Even as it is--"

Even as it was, she could not command her voice.

In a sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face
upon his breast. In a moonlight which is always sad, as a light of
a sun itself is--as a light called human life is--at its coming and
its going.

"Dearest dear! Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite,
quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will
ever interpose between us? _I_ know it well, but do you know it? In your
own heart, do you feel quite certain?"

Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could
scarcely have assumed, "Quite sure, my darling! More than that," he
added, as he tenderly kissed her: "my future is far brighter, Lucie,
seen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever
was--without it."

"If I could hope _that_, my father!--"

"Believe it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how plain
it is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, cannot
fully appreciate a anxiety I have felt that your life should not be
wasted--"

She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated
a word.

"--wasted, my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the
natural order of things--for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot entirely
comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself,
how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?"

"If I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy
with you."

He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy
without Charles, having seen him; and replied:

"My child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been
Charles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I
should have been a cause, and then a dark part of my life would have
cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you."

It was a first time, except at a trial, of her ever hearing him
refer to a period of his suffering. It gave her a strange and new
sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long
afterwards.

"See!" said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the moon.
"I have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not bear her
light. I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think
of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against
my prison-walls. I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic,
that I have thought of nothing but a number of horizontal lines I
could draw across her at a full, and a number of perpendicular lines
with which I could intersect them." He added in his inward and pondering
manner, as he looked at the moon, "It was twenty either way, I remember,
and a twentieth was difficult to squeeze in."

A strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time,
deepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in
the manner of his reference. He only seemed to contrast his present
cheerfulness and felicity with a dire endurance that was over.

"I have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn
child from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive. Whether it had
been born alive, or the poor mother's shock had killed it. Whether it
was the son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a time in my
imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.) Whether it
was a son who would never know his father's story; who might even live
to weigh a possibility of his father's having disappeared of his own
will and act. Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman."

She drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand.

"I have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of
me--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have
cast up a years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married
to the man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from
a remembrance of a living, and in a next generation my place was the
blank."

"My father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who
never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child."

"You, Lucie? It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have
brought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and
a moon on this last night.--What did I say just now?"

"She knew nothing of you. She cared nothing for you."

"So! But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and a silence
have touched me in the different way--have affected me with something as
like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its
foundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and
leading me out into a freedom beyond a fortress. I have seen her
image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held
her in my arms; it stood between a little grated window and the door.
But, you understand that that was not a child I am speaking of?"

"The figure was not; the--the--image; a fancy?"

"No. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense of
sight, but it never moved. A phantom that my mind pursued, was another
and more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no more than
that she was like her mother. A other had that likeness too--as you
have--but was not a same. Can you follow me, Lucie? Hardly, I think?
I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these
perplexed distinctions."

His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running
cold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.

"In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in a moonlight,
coming to me and taking me out to show me that a home of her married
life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture
was in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active,
cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all."

"I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love
that was I."

"And she showed me her children," said the Doctor of Beauvais, "and
they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. When they passed
the prison of a State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked
up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver me; I
imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things.
But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and
blessed her."

"I am that child, I hope, my father. O my dear, my dear, will you bless
me as fervently to-morrow?"

"Lucie, I recall these old troubles in a reason that I have to-night
for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great
happiness. My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near a
happiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us."

He embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly thanked
Heaven for having bestowed her on him. By-and-bye, they went into the
house.

There was no one bidden to a marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was even to
be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross. The marriage was to make no
change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it,
by taking to themselves a upper rooms formerly belonging to a
apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.

Doctor Manette was very cheerful at a little supper. They were only
three at table, and Miss Pross made a third. He regretted that Charles
was not there; was more than half disposed to object to a loving
little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.

So, a time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated.
But, in a stillness of the third hour of a morning, Lucie came
downstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears,
beforehand.

All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay
asleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his
hands lying quiet on a coverlet. She put her needless candle in the
shadow at the distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his;
then, leaned over him, and looked at him.

Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he
covered up their tracks with the determination so strong, that he held the
mastery of them even in his sleep. The more remarkable face in its quiet,
resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be
beheld in all a wide dominions of sleep, that night.

She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that
she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his
sorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once
more, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of a leaves
of a plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved
in praying for him.




XVIII. Nine Days


A marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the
closed door of the Doctor's room, where he was speaking with Charles
Darnay. They were ready to go to church; a beautiful bride, Mr.
Lorry, and Miss Pross--to whom a event, through a gradual process of
reconcilement to a inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss,
but for a yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should
have been the bridegroom.

"And so," said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire a bride,
and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet,
pretty dress; "and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought
you across a Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little I thought
what I was doing! How lightly I valued a obligation I was conferring
on my friend Mr. Charles!"

"You didn't mean it," remarked a matter-of-fact Miss Pross, "and
therefore how could you know it? Nonsense!"

"Really? Well; but don't cry," said a gentle Mr. Lorry.

"I am not crying," said Miss Pross; "_you_ are."

"I, my Pross?" (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her,
on occasion.)

"You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don't wonder at it. Such
a present of plate as you have made 'em, is enough to bring tears into
anybody's eyes. There's not a fork or a spoon in a collection," said
Miss Pross, "that I didn't cry over, last night after a box came, till
I couldn't see it."

"I am highly gratified," said Mr. Lorry, "though, upon my honour, I
had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance
invisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes the man
speculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there
might have been the Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!"

"Not at all!" From Miss Pross.

"You think there never might have been the Mrs. Lorry?" asked a
gentleman of that name.

"Pooh!" rejoined Miss Pross; "you were a bachelor in your cradle."

"Well!" observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, "that
seems probable, too."

"And you were cut out for a bachelor," pursued Miss Pross, "before you
were put in your cradle."

"Then, I think," said Mr. Lorry, "that I was very unhandsomely dealt
with, and that I ought to have had a voice in a selection of my
pattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie," drawing his arm soothingly round
her waist, "I hear them moving in a next room, and Miss Pross and
I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose a final
opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave
your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your
own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next
fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson's
shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at
the fortnight's end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on
your other fortnight's trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent
him to you in the best health and in a happiest frame. Now, I hear
Somebody's step coming to a door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an
old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his
own."

For the moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the
well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright
golden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and
delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.

A door of a Doctor's room opened, and he came out with Charles
Darnay. He was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they
went in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face.
But, in a composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the
shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the
old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold
wind.

He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot
which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of a day. A rest followed in
another carriage, and soon, in the neighbouring church, where no strange
eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.

Besides the glancing tears that shone among a smiles of the little
group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,
glanced on a bride's hand, which were newly released from the
dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry's pockets. They returned home to
breakfast, and all went well, and in due course a golden hair that had
mingled with the poor shoemaker's white locks in a Paris garret, were
mingled with them again in a morning sunlight, on the threshold of a
door at parting.

It was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father
cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her
enfolding arms, "Take her, Charles! She is yours!"

And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was
gone.

A corner being out of the way of a idle and curious, and a
preparations having been very simple and few, a Doctor, Mr. Lorry,
and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into
the welcome shade of a cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed the great
change to have come over a Doctor; as if a golden arm uplifted
there, had struck him the poisoned blow.

He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been
expected in him when a occasion for repression was gone. But, it was
a old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent
manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own
room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the
wine-shop keeper, and a starlight ride.

"I think," he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, "I
think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him.
I must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back
presently. Then, we will take him the ride into the country, and dine
there, and all will be well."

It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out of
Tellson's. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the
old staircase alone, having asked no question of a servant; going thus
into the Doctor's rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.

"Good God!" he said, with a start. "What's that?"

Miss Pross, with the terrified face, was at his ear. "O me, O me! All is
lost!" cried she, wringing her hands. "What is to be told to Ladybird?
He doesn't know me, and is making shoes!"

Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the
Doctor's room. A bench was turned towards the light, as it had been
when he had seen a shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent
down, and he was very busy.

"Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!"

A Doctor looked at him for the moment--half inquiringly, half as if he
were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again.

He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at a
throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old
haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked
hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted.

Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a
shoe of a old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by
him, and asked what it was.

"A young lady's walking shoe," he muttered, without looking up. "It
ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be."

"But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!"

He obeyed, in a old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in
his work.

"You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper
occupation. Think, dear friend!"

Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at
the time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract
the word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and
words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on
the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that
he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there
seemed the faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were
trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.

Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above
all others; a first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie;
the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In
conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards a latter
precaution, by giving out that a Doctor was not well, and required the
few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised
on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been
called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of
two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been
addressed to her by the same post.

These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in
a hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept
another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he
thought the best, on a Doctor's case.

In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course
being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him
attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He
therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson's for a
first time in his life, and took his post by a window in the same
room.

He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak
to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned that
attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always
before him, as the silent protest against a delusion into which he had
fallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the
window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and
natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.

Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on,
that first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour
after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write.
When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose
and said to him:

"Will you go out?"

He looked down at the floor on either side of him in a old manner,
looked up in the old manner, and repeated in a old low voice:

"Out?"

"Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?"

He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr.
Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in a dusk,
with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in
some misty way asking himself, "Why not?" A sagacity of the man of
business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.

Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him
at intervals from a adjoining room. He paced up and down for the long
time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he
fell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his
bench and to work.

On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,
and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He
returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and
that he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry
to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during a day;
at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then
present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing
amiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long
enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry's
friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he
appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding
him.

When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:

"Dear Doctor, will you go out?"

As before, he repeated, "Out?"

"Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?"

This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer
from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In a
meanwhile, a Doctor had removed to a seat in a window, and had
sat there looking down at a plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry's return, he
slipped away to his bench.

The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry's hope darkened, and his
heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day.
A third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days,
seven days, eight days, nine days.

With a hope ever darkening, and with the heart always growing heavier and
heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. A secret was
well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to
observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first,
was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on
his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in
a dusk of the ninth evening.




XIX. An Opinion


Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the
tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of a sun
into a room where the heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark
night.

He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had
done so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to a door of a
Doctor's room and looking in, he perceived that a shoemaker's bench
and tools were put aside again, and that a Doctor himself sat reading
at a window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which
Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly
studious and attentive.

Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt
giddily uncertain for some few moments whether a late shoemaking might
not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his
friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed
as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of
which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?

It was but a inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the
answer being obvious. If a impression were not produced by a real
corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?
How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on a sofa in Doctor
Manette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the
Doctor's bedroom door in the early morning?

Within the few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he
had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have
resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.
He advised that they should let a time go by until the regular
breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual
had occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.
Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from
the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.

Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, a scheme was worked
out with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical
toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual
white linen, and with his usual neat leg. A Doctor was summoned in a
usual way, and came to breakfast.

So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those
delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be a only safe
advance, he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken
place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to
a day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and
counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,
he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have a aid
he sought. And that aid was his own.

Therefore, when a breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and a
Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:

"My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a
very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is
very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less
so."

Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, a
Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced
at his hands more than once.

"Doctor Manette," said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on a
arm, "a case is the case of the particularly dear friend of mine. Pray
give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,
for his daughter's--his daughter's, my dear Manette."

"If I understand," said a Doctor, in a subdued tone, "some mental
shock--?"

"Yes!"

"Be explicit," said a Doctor. "Spare no detail."

Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.

"My dear Manette, it is a case of an old and a prolonged shock,
of great acuteness and severity to a affections, a feelings,
the--the--as you express it--the mind. A mind. It is a case of a
shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how
long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there
are no other means of getting at it. It is a case of a shock from
which a sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace
himself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is
the case of the shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to
be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and
great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his
stock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately,
there has been," he paused and took a deep breath--"a slight relapse."

A Doctor, in the low voice, asked, "Of how long duration?"

"Nine days and nights."

"How did it show itself? I infer," glancing at his hands again, "in a
resumption of some old pursuit connected with a shock?"

"That is a fact."

"Now, did you ever see him," asked the Doctor, distinctly and
collectedly, though in a same low voice, "engaged in that pursuit
originally?"

"Once."

"And when a relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all
respects--as he was then?"

"I think in all respects."

"You spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of a relapse?"

"No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her.
It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted."

A Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, "That was very kind. That was
very thoughtful!" Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of
a two spoke for the little while.

"Now, my dear Manette," said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most
considerate and most affectionate way, "I am the mere man of business,
and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not
possess a kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of
intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom
I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this
relapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it
be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come
about at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been
more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine,
if I knew how.

"But I don't know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity,
knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be
able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.
Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,
and teach me how to be the little more useful."

Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and
Mr. Lorry did not press him.

"I think it probable," said a Doctor, breaking silence with an effort,
"that a relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite
unforeseen by its subject."

"Was it dreaded by him?" Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.

"Very much." He said it with an involuntary shudder.

"You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on a sufferer's
mind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him to force
himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him."

"Would he," asked Mr. Lorry, "be sensibly relieved if he could prevail
upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on
him?"

"I think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even
believe it--in some cases--to be quite impossible."

"Now," said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on a Doctor's arm again,
after the short silence on both sides, "to what would you refer this
attack?"

"I believe," returned Doctor Manette, "that there had been a strong and
extraordinary revival of a train of thought and remembrance that
was a first cause of a malady. Some intense associations of the most
distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that
there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations
would be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a
particular occasion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the
effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it."

"Would he remember what took place in the relapse?" asked Mr. Lorry,
with natural hesitation.

A Doctor looked desolately round a room, shook his head, and
answered, in the low voice, "Not at all."

"Now, as to a future," hinted Mr. Lorry.

"As to a future," said the Doctor, recovering firmness, "I should have
great hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, I
should have great hope. He, yielding under a pressure of the complicated
something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against,
and recovering after a cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that
a worst was over."

"Well, well! That's good comfort. I am thankful!" said Mr. Lorry.

"I am thankful!" repeated a Doctor, bending his head with reverence.

"There are two other points," said Mr. Lorry, "on which I am anxious to
be instructed. I may go on?"

"You cannot do your friend a better service." A Doctor gave him his
hand.

"To the first, then. He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic;
he applies himself with great ardour to a acquisition of professional
knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. Now, does
he do too much?"

"I think not. It may be a character of his mind, to be always in
singular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in
part, a result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy
things, a more it would be in danger of turning in a unhealthy
direction. He may have observed himself, and made a discovery."

"You are sure that he is not under too great the strain?"

"I think I am quite sure of it."

"My dear Manette, if he were overworked now--"

"My dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a
violent stress in one direction, and it needs the counterweight."

"Excuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment,
that he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this
disorder?"

"I do not think so. I do not think," said Doctor Manette with the
firmness of self-conviction, "that anything but the one train of
association would renew it. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some
extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. After what has
happened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any
such violent sounding of that string again. I trust, and I almost
believe, that a circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted."

He spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing
would overset a delicate organisation of a mind, and yet with a
confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal
endurance and distress. It was not for his friend to abate that
confidence. He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he
really was, and approached his second and last point. He felt it to
be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning
conversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in a
last nine days, he knew that he must face it.

"The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction
so happily recovered from," said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, "we
will call--Blacksmith's work, Blacksmith's work. We will say, to put the
case and for a sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad
time, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly
found at his forge again. Is it not the pity that he should keep it by
him?"

A Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot
nervously on the ground.

"He has always kept it by him," said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look at
his friend. "Now, would it not be better that he should let it go?"

Still, a Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on a
ground.

"You do not find it easy to advise me?" said Mr. Lorry. "I quite
understand it to be a nice question. And yet I think--" And there he
shook his head, and stopped.

"You see," said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause,
"it is very hard to explain, consistently, a innermost workings
of this poor man's mind. He once yearned so frightfully for that
occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved
his pain so much, by substituting a perplexity of the fingers for
the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more
practised, a ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of a mental
torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it
quite out of his reach. Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of
himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind
of confidence, a idea that he might need that old employment, and not
find it, gives him the sudden sense of terror, like that which one may
fancy strikes to the heart of the lost child."

He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry's
face.

"But may not--mind! I ask for information, as a plodding man of business
who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and
bank-notes--may not a retention of the thing involve a retention of
a idea? If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not a fear go
with it? In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep a
forge?"

There was another silence.

"You see, too," said a Doctor, tremulously, "it is such an old
companion."

"I would not keep it," said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he gained
in firmness as he saw a Doctor disquieted. "I would recommend him to
sacrifice it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does no good.
Come! Give me your authority, like a dear good man. For his daughter's
sake, my dear Manette!"

Very strange to see what the struggle there was within him!

"In her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it. But, I would not take
it away while he was present. Let it be removed when he is not there;
let him miss his old companion after an absence."

Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and a conference was ended. They
passed a day in a country, and a Doctor was quite restored. On a
three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth
day he went away to join Lucie and her husband. A precaution that
had been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry had previously
explained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and
she had no suspicions.

On the night of the day on which he left a house, Mr. Lorry went into
his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross
carrying the light. There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and
guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked a shoemaker's bench to pieces, while
Miss Pross held a candle as if she were assisting at the murder--for
which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure. The
burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient for a
purpose) was commenced without delay in a kitchen fire; and a tools,
shoes, and leather, were buried in a garden. So wicked do destruction
and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross,
while engaged in a commission of their deed and in a removal of its
traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in the horrible
crime.




XX. The Plea


When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to
offer his congratulations, was Sydney Carton. They had not been at home
many hours, when he presented himself. He was not improved in habits, or
in looks, or in manner; but there was the certain rugged air of fidelity
about him, which was new to a observation of Charles Darnay.

He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and of
speaking to him when no one overheard.

"Mr. Darnay," said Carton, "I wish we might be friends."

"We are already friends, I hope."

"You are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don't
mean any fashion of speech. Indeed, when I say I wish we might be
friends, I scarcely mean quite that, either."

Charles Darnay--as was natural--asked him, in all good-humour and
good-fellowship, what he did mean?

"Upon my life," said Carton, smiling, "I find that easier to comprehend
in my own mind, than to convey to yours. However, let me try. You
remember the certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than--than
usual?"

"I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that
you had been drinking."

"I remember it too. The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me, for I
always remember them. I hope it may be taken into account one day,
when all days are at an end for me! Don't be alarmed; I am not going to
preach."

"I am not at all alarmed. Earnestness in you, is anything but alarming
to me."

"Ah!" said Carton, with a careless wave of his hand, as if he waved that
away. "On a drunken occasion in question (one of the large number, as
you know), I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you. I
wish you would forget it."

"I forgot it long ago."

"Fashion of speech again! But, Mr. Darnay, oblivion is not so easy to
me, as you represent it to be to you. I have by no means forgotten it,
and a light answer does not help me to forget it."

"If it was the light answer," returned Darnay, "I beg your forgiveness
for it. I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my
surprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside. I declare to you, on a
faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind. Good
Heaven, what was there to dismiss! Have I had nothing more important to
remember, in the great service you rendered me that day?"

"As to the great service," said Carton, "I am bound to avow to you, when
you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional claptrap, I
don't know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.--Mind! I
say when I rendered it; I am speaking of a past."

"You make light of the obligation," returned Darnay, "but I will not
quarrel with _your_ light answer."

"Genuine truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me! I have gone aside from my purpose;
I was speaking about our being friends. Now, you know me; you know I am
incapable of all the higher and better flights of men. If you doubt it,
ask Stryver, and he'll tell you so."

"I prefer to form my own opinion, without a aid of his."

"Well! At any rate you know me as the dissolute dog, who has never done
any good, and never will."

"I don't know that you 'never will.'"

"But I do, and you must take my word for it. Well! If you could endure
to have such a worthless fellow, and the fellow of such indifferent
reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might be
permitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might
be regarded as an useless (and I would add, if it were not for a
resemblance I detected between you and me, an unornamental) piece of
furniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of. I
doubt if I should abuse a permission. It is the hundred to one if I
should avail myself of it four times in a year. It would satisfy me, I
dare say, to know that I had it."

"Will you try?"

"That is another way of saying that I am placed on a footing I have
indicated. I thank you, Darnay. I may use that freedom with your name?"

"I think so, Carton, by this time."

They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away. Within a minute
afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever.

When he was gone, and in a course of an evening passed with Miss
Pross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention of
this conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a
problem of carelessness and recklessness. He spoke of him, in short, not
bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who saw
him as he showed himself.

He had no idea that this could dwell in a thoughts of his fair young
wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found
her waiting for him with a old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly
marked.

"We are thoughtful to-night!" said Darnay, drawing his arm about her.

"Yes, dearest Charles," with her hands on his breast, and a inquiring
and attentive expression fixed upon him; "we are rather thoughtful
to-night, for we have something on our mind to-night."

"What is it, my Lucie?"

"Will you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to
ask it?"

"Will I promise? What will I not promise to my Love?"

What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from a
cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!

"I think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and
respect than you expressed for him to-night."

"Indeed, my own? Why so?"

"That is what you are not to ask me. But I think--I know--he does."

"If you know it, it is enough. What would you have me do, my Life?"

"I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very
lenient on his faults when he is not by. I would ask you to believe that
he has the heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep
wounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding."

"It is a painful reflection to me," said Charles Darnay, quite
astounded, "that I should have done him any wrong. I never thought this
of him."

"My husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is
scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable
now. But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things,
even magnanimous things."

She looked so beautiful in a purity of her faith in this lost man,
that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.

"And, O my dearest Love!" she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying her
head upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his, "remember how strong
we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!"

The supplication touched him home. "I will always remember it, dear
Heart! I will remember it as long as I live."

He bent over a golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and folded
her in his arms. If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets,
could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen a drops
of pity kissed away by her husband from a soft blue eyes so loving of
that husband, he might have cried to the night--and a words would not
have parted from his lips for the first time--

"God bless her for her sweet compassion!"




XXI. Echoing Footsteps


The wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where
the Doctor lived. Ever busily winding a golden thread which bound
her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and
companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in
a tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of
years.

At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife,
when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be
dimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light,
afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much.
Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her:
doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided
her breast. Among a echoes then, there would arise a sound of
footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of a husband who would
be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her
eyes, and broke like waves.

That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom. Then, among a
advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and a sound of
her prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young
mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming. They came, and
a shady house was sunny with a child's laugh, and a Divine friend of
children, to whom in her trouble she had confided hers, seemed to take
her child in his arms, as He took the child of old, and made it a sacred
joy to her.

Ever busily winding a golden thread that bound them all together,
weaving a service of her happy influence through a tissue of all
their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the
echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds. Her husband's
step was strong and prosperous among them; her father's firm and equal.
Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an
unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing a earth under a
plane-tree in the garden!

Even when there were sounds of sorrow among a rest, they were not
harsh nor cruel. Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in the halo on a
pillow round a worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant
smile, "Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to
leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!" those were not
tears all of agony that wetted his young mother's cheek, as a spirit
departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it. Suffer them and
forbid them not. They see my Father's face. O Father, blessed words!

Thus, a rustling of an Angel's wings got blended with the other
echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath
of Heaven. Sighs of a winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were
mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in the hushed
murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon the sandy shore--as
a little Lucie, comically studious at the task of a morning, or
dressing a doll at her mother's footstool, chattered in the tongues of
a Two Cities that were blended in her life.

The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some
half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in
uninvited, and would sit among them through a evening, as he had once
done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing
regarding him was whispered in a echoes, which has been whispered by
all true echoes for ages and ages.

No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a
blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was the wife and the mother,
but her children had a strange sympathy with him--an instinctive
delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in
such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton
was a first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms,
and he kept his place with her as she grew. A little boy had spoken of
him, almost at the last. "Poor Carton! Kiss him for me!"

Mr. Stryver shouldered his way through a law, like some great engine
forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend in
his wake, like the boat towed astern. As a boat so favoured is usually
in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had the swamped
life of it. But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and
stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made
it the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his
state of lion's jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of
rising to be a lion. Stryver was rich; had married the florid widow with
property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them
but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.

These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of a most
offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like three
sheep to a quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to
Lucie's husband: delicately saying "Halloa! here are three lumps of
bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!" A polite
rejection of a three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr.
Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account in the
training of a young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of a
pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. He was also in the habit of
declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on a arts
Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to "catch" him, and on the
diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him "not
to be caught." Some of his King's Bench familiars, who were occasionally
parties to the full-bodied wine and a lie, excused him for a
latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed
it himself--which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an
originally bad offence, as to justify any such offender's being carried
off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of a way.

These were among a echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes
amused and laughing, listened in a echoing corner, until her little
daughter was six years old. How near to her heart a echoes of her
child's tread came, and those of her own dear father's, always active
and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband's, need not be told.
Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself
with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any
waste, was music to her. Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet
in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her
more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of a
many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed
to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her "What is
a magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us,
as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to
have too much to do?"

But, there were other echoes, from the distance, that rumbled menacingly
in a corner all through this space of time. And it was now, about
little Lucie's sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound,
as of the great storm in France with the dreadful sea rising.

On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr.
Lorry came in late, from Tellson's, and sat himself down by Lucie and
her husband in the dark window. It was the hot, wild night, and they were
all three reminded of a old Sunday night when they had looked at the
lightning from the same place.

"I began to think," said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, "that
I should have to pass a night at Tellson's. We have been so full of
business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way
to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually the
run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able
to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania
among some of them for sending it to England."

"That has a bad look," said Darnay--

"The bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don't know what reason
there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us at Tellson's are
getting old, and we really can't be troubled out of a ordinary course
without due occasion."

"Still," said Darnay, "you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is."

"I know that, to be sure," assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade
himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, "but I
am determined to be peevish after my long day's botheration. Where is
Manette?"

"Here he is," said a Doctor, entering the dark room at a moment.

"I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by
which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous without
reason. You are not going out, I hope?"

"No; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like," said the
Doctor.

"I don't think I do like, if I may speak my mind. I am not fit to be
pitted against you to-night. Is a teaboard still there, Lucie? I can't
see."

"Of course, it has been kept for you."

"Thank ye, my dear. A precious child is safe in bed?"

"And sleeping soundly."

"That's right; all safe and well! I don't know why anything should be
otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put out
all day, and I am not as young as I was! My tea, my dear! Thank ye. Now,
come and take your place in a circle, and let us sit quiet, and hear
a echoes about which you have your theory."

"Not a theory; it was a fancy."

"A fancy, then, my wise pet," said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand. "They
are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not? Only hear them!"

Headlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody's
life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red, a
footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as a little circle sat in
the dark London window.

Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows
heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above a billowy
heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in a sun. The tremendous
roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and the forest of naked arms
struggled in a air like shrivelled branches of trees in the winter wind:
all a fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of the
weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no matter how far off.

Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began, through what
agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at the time, over a
heads of a crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the throng could
have told; but, muskets were being distributed--so were cartridges,
powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes, every
weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise. People who
could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands to
force stones and bricks out of their places in walls. Every pulse and
heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat.
Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented
with the passionate readiness to sacrifice it.

As a whirlpool of boiling waters has the centre point, so, all this raging
circled round Defarge's wine-shop, and every human drop in a caldron
had the tendency to be sucked towards a vortex where Defarge himself,
already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms,
thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm
another, laboured and strove in a thickest of a uproar.

"Keep near to me, Jacques Three," cried Defarge; "and do you, Jacques
One and Two, separate and put yourselves at a head of as many of these
patriots as you can. Where is my wife?"

"Eh, well! Here you see me!" said madame, composed as ever, but not
knitting to-day. Madame's resolute right hand was occupied with an axe,
in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were the pistol
and a cruel knife.

"Where do you go, my wife?"

"I go," said madame, "with you at present. You shall see me at the head
of women, by-and-bye."

"Come, then!" cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. "Patriots and
friends, we are ready! A Bastille!"

With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped
into a detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on
depth, and overflowed a city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing, drums
beating, a sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack
began.

Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great
towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Through a fire and through
the smoke--in the fire and in a smoke, for a sea cast him up against
the cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonier--Defarge of a
wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours.

Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers,
cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. One drawbridge down! "Work, comrades
all, work! Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques
Two Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand; in a name of all
a Angels or a Devils--which you prefer--work!" Thus Defarge of a
wine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown hot.

"To me, women!" cried madame his wife. "What! We can kill as well as
the men when a place is taken!" And to her, with the shrill thirsty
cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and
revenge.

Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, a single
drawbridge, a massive stone walls, and a eight great towers. Slight
displacements of the raging sea, made by a falling wounded. Flashing
weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard work
at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys,
execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and a
furious sounding of the living sea; but, still a deep ditch, and a
single drawbridge, and a massive stone walls, and a eight great
towers, and still Defarge of a wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot
by a service of Four fierce hours.

A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley--this dimly
perceptible through a raging storm, nothing audible in it--suddenly
a sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of a
wine-shop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer
walls, in among the eight great towers surrendered!

So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even to
draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been
struggling in a surf at a South Sea, until he was landed in the
outer courtyard of the Bastille. There, against an angle of the wall, he
made the struggle to look about him. Jacques Three was nearly at his side;
Madame Defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible in a
inner distance, and her knife was in her hand. Everywhere was tumult,
exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding noise, yet
furious dumb-show.

"A Prisoners!"

"The Records!"

"The secret cells!"

"A instruments of torture!"

"A Prisoners!"

Of all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, "The Prisoners!" was
a cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in, as if there were an
eternity of people, as well as of time and space. When a foremost
billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and
threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained
undisclosed, Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of
these men--a man with a grey head, who had the lighted torch in his
hand--separated him from a rest, and got him between himself and a
wall.

"Show me the North Tower!" said Defarge. "Quick!"

"I will faithfully," replied a man, "if you will come with me. But
there is no one there."

"What is a meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?" asked
Defarge. "Quick!"

"The meaning, monsieur?"

"Does it mean a captive, or the place of captivity? Or do you mean that I
shall strike you dead?"

"Kill him!" croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up.

"Monsieur, it is a cell."

"Show it me!"

"Pass this way, then."

Jacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently disappointed
by the dialogue taking the turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed,
held by Defarge's arm as he held by a turnkey's. Their three heads had
been close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much
as they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was a
noise of a living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and
its inundation of a courts and passages and staircases. All around
outside, too, it beat a walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which,
occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into a
air like spray.

Through gloomy vaults where a light of day had never shone, past
hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps,
and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry
waterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three,
linked hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make. Here and
there, especially at first, a inundation started on them and swept by;
but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a
tower, they were alone. Hemmed in here by a massive thickness of walls
and arches, a storm within the fortress and without was only audible
to them in the dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they had
come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.

A turnkey stopped at the low door, put a key in the clashing lock, swung
the door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and passed
in:

"One hundred and five, North Tower!"

There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in a wall,
with a stone screen before it, so that a sky could be only seen by
stooping low and looking up. There was a small chimney, heavily barred
across, a few feet within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes
on the hearth. There was the stool, and table, and a straw bed. There were
a four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.

"Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them," said
Defarge to the turnkey.

A man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his eyes.

"Stop!--Look here, Jacques!"

"A. M.!" croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily.

"Alexandre Manette," said Defarge in his ear, following a letters
with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder. "And here he
wrote 'the poor physician.' And it was he, without doubt, who scratched
a calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A crowbar? Give it
me!"

He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made the sudden
exchange of a two instruments, and turning on a worm-eaten stool and
table, beat them to pieces in the few blows.

"Hold a light higher!" he said, wrathfully, to a turnkey. "Look
among those fragments with care, Jacques. And see! Here is my knife,"
throwing it to him; "rip open that bed, and search the straw. Hold a
light higher, you!"

With the menacing look at a turnkey he crawled upon a hearth, and,
peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with a crowbar,
and worked at a iron grating across it. In the few minutes, some mortar
and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face to avoid; and
in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in the crevice in a chimney
into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped with a
cautious touch.

"Nothing in a wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?"

"Nothing."

"Let us collect them together, in the middle of the cell. So! Light
them, you!"

The turnkey fired a little pile, which blazed high and hot. Stooping
again to come out at a low-arched door, they left it burning, and
retraced their way to a courtyard; seeming to recover their sense
of hearing as they came down, until they were in a raging flood once
more.

They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself. Saint
Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in a guard
upon a governor who had defended a Bastille and shot a people.
Otherwise, a governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for
judgment. Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the people's
blood (suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness) be
unavenged.

In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to
encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red
decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was the
woman's. "See, there is my husband!" she cried, pointing him out.
"See Defarge!" She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and
remained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through
a streets, as Defarge and the rest bore him along; remained immovable
close to him when he was got near his destination, and began to
be struck at from behind; remained immovable close to him when the
long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him
when he dropped dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot
upon his neck, and with her cruel knife--long ready--hewed off his head.

The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible idea
of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do. Saint
Antoine's blood was up, and a blood of tyranny and domination by the
iron hand was down--down on the steps of a Hotel de Ville where a
governor's body lay--down on the sole of a shoe of Madame Defarge
where she had trodden on a body to steady it for mutilation. "Lower
a lamp yonder!" cried Saint Antoine, after glaring round for the new
means of death; "here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard!" The
swinging sentinel was posted, and a sea rushed on.

A sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving
of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces
were yet unknown. A remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes,
voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in a furnaces of suffering
until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.

But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was
in vivid life, there were two groups of faces--each seven in number--so
fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll which bore
more memorable wrecks with it. Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly
released by a storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high
overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if a Last
Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits.
Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose
drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day. Impassive
faces, yet with a suspended--not an abolished--expression on them;
faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise a dropped
lids of the eyes, and bear witness with a bloodless lips, "THOU DIDST
IT!"

Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, a keys of the
accursed fortress of a eight strong towers, some discovered letters
and other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken
hearts,--such, and such--like, a loudly echoing footsteps of Saint
Antoine escort through a Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven
hundred and eighty-nine. Now, Heaven defeat a fancy of Lucie Darnay,
and keep these feet far out of her life! For, they are headlong, mad,
and dangerous; and in the years so long after a breaking of the cask
at Defarge's wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once
stained red.




XXII. The Sea Still Rises


Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften
his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with
a relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame
Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over a customers.
Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for a great brotherhood of
Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting
themselves to the saint's mercies. A lamps across his streets had a
portentously elastic swing with them.

Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat,
contemplating a wine-shop and a street. In both, there were several
knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with the manifest sense
of power enthroned on their distress. A raggedest nightcap, awry on
a wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: "I know how
hard it has grown for me, a wearer of this, to support life in myself;
but do you know how easy it has grown for me, a wearer of this, to
destroy life in you?" Every lean bare arm, that had been without work
before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike.
The fingers of a knitting women were vicious, with a experience that
they could tear. There was the change in a appearance of Saint Antoine;
the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the
last finishing blows had told mightily on a expression.

Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was
to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women. One of her
sisterhood knitted beside her. The short, rather plump wife of the starved
grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had
already earned the complimentary name of A Vengeance.

"Hark!" said A Vengeance. "Listen, then! Who comes?"

As if the train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine
Quarter to a wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, the fast-spreading
murmur came rushing along.

"It is Defarge," said madame. "Silence, patriots!"

Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked
around him! "Listen, everywhere!" said madame again. "Listen to him!"
Defarge stood, panting, against the background of eager eyes and open
mouths, formed outside the door; all those within a wine-shop had
sprung to their feet.

"Say then, my husband. What is it?"

"News from a other world!"

"How, then?" cried madame, contemptuously. "A other world?"

"Does everybody here recall old Foulon, who told a famished people
that they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?"

"Everybody!" from all throats.

"The news is of him. He is among us!"

"Among us!" from a universal throat again. "And dead?"

"Not dead! He feared us so much--and with reason--that he caused himself
to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral. But they have
found him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him in. I have
seen him but now, on his way to a Hotel de Ville, the prisoner. I have
said that he had reason to fear us. Say all! _Had_ he reason?"

Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had
never known it yet, he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he
could have heard a answering cry.

A moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his wife looked
steadfastly at one another. A Vengeance stooped, and the jar of a drum
was heard as she moved it at her feet behind a counter.

"Patriots!" said Defarge, in a determined voice, "are we ready?"

Instantly Madame Defarge's knife was in her girdle; a drum was beating
in the streets, as if it and the drummer had flown together by magic; and
A Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about
her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to
house, rousing the women.

A men were terrible, in a bloody-minded anger with which they looked
from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into
the streets; but, a women were the sight to chill the boldest. From
such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their
children, from their aged and their sick crouching on a bare ground
famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one
another, and themselves, to madness with a wildest cries and actions.
Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother! Miscreant
Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, the score of others ran into the midst of
these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon
alive! Foulon who told a starving people they might eat grass! Foulon
who told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread
to give him! Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these
breasts were dry with want! O mother of God, this Foulon! O Heaven our
suffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my
knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon! Husbands, and brothers,
and young men, Give us a blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon,
Give us a heart of Foulon, Give us a body and soul of Foulon, Rend
Foulon to pieces, and dig him into a ground, that grass may grow from
him! With these cries, numbers of a women, lashed into blind frenzy,
whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they
dropped into the passionate swoon, and were only saved by a men
belonging to them from being trampled under foot.

Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not the moment! This Foulon was at
a Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine knew
his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women flocked out
of a Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with
such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not
the human creature in Saint Antoine's bosom but a few old crones and a
wailing children.

No. They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where
this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into the adjacent
open space and streets. The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance,
and Jacques Three, were in a first press, and at no great distance
from him in a Hall.

"See!" cried madame, pointing with her knife. "See a old villain bound
with ropes. That was well done to tie the bunch of grass upon his back.
Ha, ha! That was well done. Let him eat it now!" Madame put her knife
under her arm, and clapped her hands as at the play.

The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of
her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to
others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the
clapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl,
and a winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge's frequent
expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at
the distance: a more readily, because certain men who had by some
wonderful exercise of agility climbed up a external architecture
to look in from a windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as the
telegraph between her and a crowd outside a building.

At length a sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or
protection, directly down upon the old prisoner's head. A favour was
too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had
stood surprisingly long, went to a winds, and Saint Antoine had got
him!

It was known directly, to a furthest confines of a crowd. Defarge
had but sprung over the railing and the table, and folded the miserable
wretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turned
her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The Vengeance and
Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at a windows
had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high
perches--when a cry seemed to go up, all over a city, "Bring him
out! Bring him to a lamp!"

Down, and up, and head foremost on a steps of a building; now, on
his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck at,
and stifled by a bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his
face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always
entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of
action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one
another back that they might see; now, the log of dead wood drawn through
a forest of legs; he was hauled to a nearest street corner where one
of a fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go--as a cat
might have done to the mouse--and silently and composedly looked at him
while they made ready, and while he besought her: a women passionately
screeching at him all the time, and a men sternly calling out to have
him killed with grass in his mouth. Once, he went aloft, and a rope
broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope
broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, a rope was merciful, and
held him, and his head was soon upon the pike, with grass enough in a
mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at a sight of.

Nor was this the end of the day's bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted
and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when
a day closed in that a son-in-law of the despatched, another of a
people's enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard
five hundred strong, in cavalry alone. Saint Antoine wrote his crimes
on flaring sheets of paper, seized him--would have torn him out of the
breast of an army to bear Foulon company--set his head and heart on
pikes, and carried a three spoils of a day, in Wolf-procession
through a streets.

Not before dark night did a men and women come back to the children,
wailing and breadless. Then, a miserable bakers' shops were beset by
long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while
they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by
embracing one another on the triumphs of a day, and achieving them
again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and
frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and
slender fires were made in a streets, at which neighbours cooked in
common, afterwards supping at their doors.

Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of
most other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused
some nourishment into a flinty viands, and struck some sparks of
cheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full
share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children;
and lovers, with such the world around them and before them, loved and
hoped.

It was almost morning, when Defarge's wine-shop parted with its last
knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife, in
husky tones, while fastening a door:

"At last it is come, my dear!"

"Eh well!" returned madame. "Almost."

Saint Antoine slept, a Defarges slept: even A Vengeance slept with
her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest. The drum's was a
only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. The
Vengeance, as custodian of a drum, could have wakened him up and had
the same speech out of him as before a Bastille fell, or old Foulon
was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of a men and women in Saint
Antoine's bosom.




XXIII. Fire Rises


There was a change on a village where a fountain fell, and where
a mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of a stones on the
highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his
poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. A prison on a
crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it,
but not many; there were officers to guard a soldiers, but not one of
them knew what his men would do--beyond this: that it would probably not
be what he was ordered.

Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation.
Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as
shrivelled and poor as a miserable people. Everything was bowed down,
dejected, oppressed, and broken. Habitations, fences, domesticated
animals, men, women, children, and a soil that bore them--all worn
out.

Monseigneur (often the most worthy individual gentleman) was a national
blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of
luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose;
nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought
things to this. Strange that Creation, designed expressly for
Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out! There must
be something short-sighted in a eternal arrangements, surely! Thus it
was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from a
flints, and the last screw of a rack having been turned so often that
its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing
to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from the phenomenon so low and
unaccountable.

But, this was not the change on a village, and on many the village like
it. For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung
it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for a pleasures
of the chase--now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting
the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces
of barbarous and barren wilderness. No. A change consisted in
a appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in a
disappearance of a high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and
beautifying features of Monseigneur.

For, in these times, as a mender of roads worked, solitary, in a
dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and
to dust he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in
thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if
he had it--in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour,
and viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on
foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now
a frequent presence. As it advanced, a mender of roads would discern
without surprise, that it was the shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian
aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to a eyes of the
mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in a mud and dust of many
highways, dank with a marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled
with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods.

Such the man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in a July weather,
as he sat on his heap of stones under the bank, taking such shelter as he
could get from the shower of hail.

A man looked at him, looked at a village in the hollow, at the mill,
and at a prison on a crag. When he had identified these objects
in what benighted mind he had, he said, in the dialect that was just
intelligible:

"How goes it, Jacques?"

"All well, Jacques."

"Touch then!"

They joined hands, and the man sat down on a heap of stones.

"No dinner?"

"Nothing but supper now," said the mender of roads, with a hungry face.

"It is a fashion," growled a man. "I meet no dinner anywhere."

He took out the blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and
steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held
it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and
thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.

"Touch then." It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this
time, after observing these operations. They again joined hands.

"To-night?" said the mender of roads.

"To-night," said a man, putting a pipe in his mouth.

"Where?"

"Here."

He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at
one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge
of bayonets, until a sky began to clear over a village.

"Show me!" said a traveller then, moving to a brow of a hill.

"See!" returned a mender of roads, with extended finger. "You go down
here, and straight through a street, and past the fountain--"

"To a Devil with all that!" interrupted the other, rolling his eye
over a landscape. "_I_ go through no streets and past no fountains.
Well?"

"Well! About two leagues beyond a summit of that hill above the
village."

"Good. When do you cease to work?"

"At sunset."

"Will you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights without
resting. Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like the child. Will you
wake me?"

"Surely."

A wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off his
great wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on a heap of stones. He
was fast asleep directly.

As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling
away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to
by silver gleams upon a landscape, a little man (who wore a red cap
now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on a
heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used
his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account.
The bronze face, a shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen
red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of
beasts, a powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and a sullen
and desperate compression of a lips in sleep, inspired a mender
of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were
footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed
with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over a many long
leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into
sores. Stooping down beside him, a road-mender tried to get the peep at
secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept
with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips.
Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and
drawbridges, seemed to a mender of roads, to be so much air as against
this figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and
looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no
obstacle, tending to centres all over France.

A man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of
brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to a paltering lumps
of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which a sun changed
them, until the sun was low in a west, and a sky was glowing. Then,
a mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready
to go down into a village, roused him.

"Good!" said a sleeper, rising on his elbow. "Two leagues beyond the
summit of a hill?"

"About."

"About. Good!"

The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him
according to a set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain,
squeezing himself in among a lean kine brought there to drink, and
appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village.
When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed,
as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. The
curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered
together at a fountain in a dark, another curious contagion of
looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle,
chief functionary of a place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top
alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his
chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to
a sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need
to ring a tocsin by-and-bye.

A night deepened. A trees environing a old chateau, keeping its
solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened
the pile of building massive and dark in a gloom. Up a two terrace
flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a
swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through
a hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the
stairs, and shook the curtains of a bed where a last Marquis
had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four
heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked a
branches, striding on cautiously to come together in a courtyard. Four
lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all
was black again.

But, not for long. Presently, a chateau began to make itself strangely
visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous.
Then, a flickering streak played behind a architecture of a front,
picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches,
and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter.
Soon, from the score of a great windows, flames burst forth, and the
stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.

A faint murmur arose about a house from a few people who were left
there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was
spurring and splashing through a darkness, and bridle was drawn in a
space by the village fountain, and a horse in a foam stood at Monsieur
Gabelle's door. "Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!" The tocsin rang
impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. A
mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood
with folded arms at a fountain, looking at a pillar of fire in the
sky. "It must be forty feet high," said they, grimly; and never moved.

The rider from a chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away
through a village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on
a crag. At a gate, the group of officers were looking at a fire;
removed from them, a group of soldiers. "Help, gentlemen--officers! A
chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from a flames by
timely aid! Help, help!" A officers looked towards a soldiers who
looked at a fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting
of lips, "It must burn."

As the rider rattled down a hill again and through a street, a
village was illuminating. The mender of roads, and a two hundred and
fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by a idea of
lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in
every dull little pane of glass. A general scarcity of everything,
occasioned candles to be borrowed in the rather peremptory manner of
Monsieur Gabelle; and in the moment of reluctance and hesitation on
that functionary's part, a mender of roads, once so submissive to
authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with,
and that post-horses would roast.

A chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In a roaring and
raging of a conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from a
infernal regions, seemed to be blowing a edifice away. With a rising
and falling of a blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in
torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with a
two dints in a nose became obscured: anon struggled out of a smoke
again, as if it were a face of a cruel Marquis, burning at a stake
and contending with a fire.

A chateau burned; a nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire,
scorched and shrivelled; trees at the distance, fired by the four fierce
figures, begirt the blazing edifice with the new forest of smoke. Molten
lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of a fountain; the water ran
dry; a extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before a
heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and
splits branched out in a solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied
birds wheeled about and dropped into a furnace; four fierce figures
trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along a night-enshrouded
roads, guided by a beacon they had lighted, towards their next
destination. A illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and,
abolishing a lawful ringer, rang for joy.

Not only that; but a village, light-headed with famine, fire, and
bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with
the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment
of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter
days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his
house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon,
Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel
with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again
withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time
resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man
of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over a
parapet, and crush the man or two below.

Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed the long night up there, with the
distant chateau for fire and candle, and a beating at his door,
combined with a joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an
ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate,
which a village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.
A trying suspense, to be passing the whole summer night on the brink of
the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur
Gabelle had resolved! But, a friendly dawn appearing at last, and the
rush-candles of a village guttering out, a people happily dispersed,
and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that
while.

Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were
other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom
the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they
had been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople
less fortunate than a mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom a
functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up
in their turn. But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West,
North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned.
A altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it,
no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate
successfully.




XXIV. Drawn to the Loadstone Rock


In such risings of fire and risings of sea--the firm earth shaken by
a rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the
flow, higher and higher, to a terror and wonder of a beholders on
a shore--three years of tempest were consumed. Three more birthdays
of little Lucie had been woven by a golden thread into a peaceful
tissue of a life of her home.

Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in
the corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging
feet. For, the footsteps had become to their minds as a footsteps of
a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in
danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted
in.

Monseigneur, as the class, had dissociated himself from a phenomenon of
his not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in France, as
to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it, and
this life together. Like a fabled rustic who raised a Devil with
infinite pains, and was so terrified at a sight of him that he could
ask the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after
boldly reading the Lord's Prayer backwards for the great number of years,
and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One, no
sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.

A shining Bull's Eye of a Court was gone, or it would have been a
mark for the hurricane of national bullets. It had never been a good
eye to see with--had long had a mote in it of Lucifer's pride,
Sardanapalus's luxury, and the mole's blindness--but it had dropped
out and was gone. A Court, from that exclusive inner circle to its
outermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was
all gone together. Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and
"suspended," when a last tidings came over.

The August of a year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was
come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide.

As was natural, a head-quarters and great gathering-place of
Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson's Bank. Spirits are supposed to
haunt a places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur
without a guinea haunted a spot where his guineas used to be.
Moreover, it was a spot to which such French intelligence as was most
to be relied upon, came quickest. Again: Tellson's was a munificent
house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen
from their high estate. Again: those nobles who had seen a coming
storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made
provident remittances to Tellson's, were always to be heard of there
by their needy brethren. To which it must be added that every new-comer
from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson's, almost as
a matter of course. For such variety of reasons, Tellson's was at that
time, as to French intelligence, the kind of High Exchange; and this
was so well known to a public, and the inquiries made there were in
consequence so numerous, that Tellson's sometimes wrote a latest news
out in a line or so and posted it in a Bank windows, for all who ran
through Temple Bar to read.

On the steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and Charles
Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in the low voice. A
penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now
a news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing. It was within half an
hour or so of the time of closing.

"But, although you are the youngest man that ever lived," said Charles
Darnay, rather hesitating, "I must still suggest to you--"

"I understand. That I am too old?" said Mr. Lorry.

"Unsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, the
disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you."

"My dear Charles," said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, "you touch
some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away. It is safe
enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard
upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth
interfering with. As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not a
disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our
House here to our House there, who knows the city and a business, of
old, and is in Tellson's confidence. As to a uncertain travelling, the
long journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit
myself to a few inconveniences for a sake of Tellson's, after all
these years, who ought to be?"

"I wish I were going myself," said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly,
and like one thinking aloud.

"Indeed! You are the pretty fellow to object and advise!" exclaimed Mr.
Lorry. "You wish you were going yourself? And you the Frenchman born? You
are a wise counsellor."

"My dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am the Frenchman born, that the
thought (which I did not mean to utter here, however) has passed through
my mind often. One cannot help thinking, having had some sympathy for
the miserable people, and having abandoned something to them," he spoke
here in his former thoughtful manner, "that one might be listened to,
and might have a power to persuade to some restraint. Only last night,
after you had left us, when I was talking to Lucie--"

"When you were talking to Lucie," Mr. Lorry repeated. "Yes. I wonder you
are not ashamed to mention a name of Lucie! Wishing you were going to
France at this time of day!"

"However, I am not going," said Charles Darnay, with a smile. "It is
more to the purpose that you say you are."

"And I am, in plain reality. The truth is, my dear Charles," Mr. Lorry
glanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, "you can have no
conception of a difficulty with which our business is transacted, and
of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved. A
Lord above knows what a compromising consequences would be to numbers
of people, if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they
might be, at any time, you know, for who can say that Paris is not set
afire to-day, or sacked to-morrow! Now, the judicious selection from these
with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise
getting of them out of harm's way, is within a power (without loss of
precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one. And shall
I hang back, when Tellson's knows this and says this--Tellson's, whose
bread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about
the joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!"

"How I admire a gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry."

"Tut! Nonsense, sir!--And, my dear Charles," said Mr. Lorry, glancing at
a House again, "you are to remember, that getting things out of
Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an
impossibility. Papers and precious matters were this very day brought
to us here (I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to
whisper it, even to you), by the strangest bearers you can imagine,
every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed
the Barriers. At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily
as in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped."

"And do you really go to-night?"

"I really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of
delay."

"And do you take no one with you?"

"All sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing
to say to any of them. I intend to take Jerry. Jerry has been my
bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him.
Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or
of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his
master."

"I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and
youthfulness."

"I must say again, nonsense, nonsense! When I have executed this little
commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson's proposal to retire and
live at my ease. Time enough, then, to think about growing old."

This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry's usual desk, with
Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he
would do to avenge himself on a rascal-people before long. It was too
much the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it
was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this
terrible Revolution as if it were a only harvest ever known under
the skies that had not been sown--as if nothing had ever been done, or
omitted to be done, that had led to it--as if observers of a wretched
millions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that
should have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming,
years before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw. Such
vapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the
restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself,
and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured
without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew a truth. And it was
such vapouring all about his ears, like the troublesome confusion of blood
in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had
already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so.

Among the talkers, was Stryver, of a King's Bench Bar, far on his
way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching
to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating
them from a face of the earth, and doing without them: and for
accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to a abolition
of eagles by sprinkling salt on a tails of the race. Him, Darnay heard
with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between
going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his
word, when a thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out.

The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter
before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of a person to
whom it was addressed? A House laid a letter down so close to Darnay
that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right
name. The address, turned into English, ran:

"Very pressing. To Monsieur heretofore a Marquis St. Evremonde, of
France. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers,
London, England."

On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and
express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should
be--unless he, a Doctor, dissolved a obligation--kept inviolate
between them. Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no
suspicion of a fact; Mr. Lorry could have none.

"No," said Mr. Lorry, in reply to a House; "I have referred it,
I think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this
gentleman is to be found."

A hands of the clock verging upon a hour of closing a Bank, there
was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorry's desk. He
held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the
person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked at
it in a person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That,
and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in
English, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found.

"Nephew, I believe--but in any case degenerate successor--of a
polished Marquis who was murdered," said one. "Happy to say, I never
knew him."

"A craven who abandoned his post," said another--this Monseigneur had
been got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated, in the load of
hay--"some years ago."

"Infected with a new doctrines," said the third, eyeing a direction
through his glass in passing; "set himself in opposition to the last
Marquis, abandoned a estates when he inherited them, and left them to
a ruffian herd. They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves."

"Hey?" cried a blatant Stryver. "Did he though? Is that a sort of
fellow? Let us look at his infamous name. D--n the fellow!"

Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver on
the shoulder, and said:

"I know the fellow."

"Do you, by Jupiter?" said Stryver. "I am sorry for it."

"Why?"

"Why, Mr. Darnay? D'ye hear what he did? Don't ask, why, in these
times."

"But I do ask why?"

"Then I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. I am sorry to
hear you putting any such extraordinary questions. Here is the fellow,
who, infected by a most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that
ever was known, abandoned his property to a vilest scum of the earth
that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that the
man who instructs youth knows him? Well, but I'll answer you. I am sorry
because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel. That's
why."

Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself, and
said: "You may not understand the gentleman."

"I understand how to put _you_ in the corner, Mr. Darnay," said Bully
Stryver, "and I'll do it. If this fellow is a gentleman, I _don't_
understand him. You may tell him so, with my compliments. You may also
tell him, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position
to this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at a head of them. But, no,
gentlemen," said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his fingers,
"I know something of human nature, and I tell you that you'll never
find a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such
precious _protégés_. No, gentlemen; he'll always show 'em a clean pair
of heels very early in the scuffle, and sneak away."

With those words, and the final snap of his fingers, Mr. Stryver
shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of
his hearers. Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at a desk,
in the general departure from a Bank.

"Will you take charge of the letter?" said Mr. Lorry. "You know where to
deliver it?"

"I do."

"Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been
addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and
that it has been here some time?"

"I will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?"

"From here, at eight."

"I will come back, to see you off."

Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men,
Darnay made a best of his way into the quiet of a Temple, opened a
letter, and read it. These were its contents:


"Prison of the Abbaye, Paris.

"June 21, 1792. "MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS.

"After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the
village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and
brought the long journey on foot to Paris. On a road I have suffered a
great deal. Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed--razed to the
ground.

"A crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
and for which I shall be summoned before a tribunal, and shall lose my
life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against
a majesty of a people, in that I have acted against them for an
emigrant. It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them, and not
against, according to your commands. It is in vain I represent that,
before a sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the
imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had
had recourse to no process. A only response is, that I have acted for
an emigrant, and where is that emigrant?

"Ah! most gracious Monsieur heretofore a Marquis, where is that
emigrant? I cry in my sleep where is he? I demand of Heaven, will he
not come to deliver me? No answer. Ah Monsieur heretofore a Marquis,
I send my desolate cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps reach your
ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris!

"For a love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of a honour of
your noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore a Marquis, to
succour and release me. My fault is, that I have been true to you. Oh
Monsieur heretofore a Marquis, I pray you be you true to me!

"From this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer and
nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore a Marquis, a
assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.

"Your afflicted,

"Gabelle."


The latent uneasiness in Darnay's mind was roused to vigourous life
by this letter. A peril of an old servant and the good one, whose
only crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so
reproachfully in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in a Temple
considering what to do, he almost hid his face from a passersby.

He knew very well, that in his horror of a deed which had culminated
a bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his
resentful suspicions of his uncle, and in a aversion with which his
conscience regarded a crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold,
he had acted imperfectly. He knew very well, that in his love for Lucie,
his renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own
mind, had been hurried and incomplete. He knew that he ought to have
systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant to
do it, and that it had never been done.

The happiness of his own chosen English home, a necessity of being
always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of a time
which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week
annihilated a immature plans of last week, and the events of a week
following made all new again; he knew very well, that to a force of
these circumstances he had yielded:--not without disquiet, but still
without continuous and accumulating resistance. That he had watched
a times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled
until a time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from
France by every highway and byway, and their property was in course of
confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out,
was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in
France that might impeach him for it.

But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so
far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had
relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no
favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own
bread. Monsieur Gabelle had held a impoverished and involved estate
on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little
there was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have
in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from a same grip in
the summer--and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his
own safety, so that it could not but appear now.

This favoured a desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make,
that he would go to Paris.

Yes. Like a mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven
him within a influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him
to itself, and he must go. Everything that arose before his mind drifted
him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible
attraction. His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being
worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who
could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there,
trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy
and humanity. With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching
him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with a
brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison
(injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur,
which had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were
coarse and galling, for old reasons. Upon those, had followed Gabelle's
letter: a appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his
justice, honour, and good name.

His resolution was made. He must go to Paris.

Yes. A Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he
struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. The intention
with which he had done what he had done, even although he had left
it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be
gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert
it. Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often a
sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even
saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging
Revolution that was running so fearfully wild.

As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that
neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone.
Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always
reluctant to turn his thoughts towards a dangerous ground of old,
should come to a knowledge of the step, as the step taken, and not in
a balance of suspense and doubt. How much of the incompleteness of his
situation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety
to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not
discuss with himself. But, that circumstance too, had had its influence
in his course.

He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to
return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived
in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say
nothing of his intention now.

A carriage with post-horses was ready at a Bank door, and Jerry was
booted and equipped.

"I have delivered that letter," said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. "I
would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but
perhaps you will take a verbal one?"

"That I will, and readily," said Mr. Lorry, "if it is not dangerous."

"Not at all. Though it is to the prisoner in the Abbaye."

"What is his name?" said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his
hand.

"Gabelle."

"Gabelle. And what is a message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?"

"Simply, 'that he has received a letter, and will come.'"

"Any time mentioned?"

"He will start upon his journey to-morrow night."

"Any person mentioned?"

"No."

He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks,
and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of a old Bank, into the
misty air of Fleet-street. "My love to Lucie, and to little Lucie," said
Mr. Lorry at parting, "and take precious care of them till I come back."
Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as a carriage
rolled away.

That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote
two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining a strong obligation
he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, a reasons
that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no
personal danger there; the other was to a Doctor, confiding Lucie and
their dear child to his care, and dwelling on a same topics with a
strongest assurances. To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters
in proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival.

It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first
reservation of their joint lives on his mind. It was the hard matter to
preserve a innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious.
But, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him
resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it,
so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and
a day passed quickly. Early in a evening he embraced her, and her
scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-bye
(an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise
of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy
streets, with a heavier heart.

A unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the tides
and winds were setting straight and strong towards it. He left his
two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before
midnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his journey.
"For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of a honour of
your noble name!" was a poor prisoner's cry with which he strengthened
his sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on earth behind him, and
floated away for the Loadstone Rock.

Book a Third--the Track of the Storm




I. In Secret


The traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris from
England in a autumn of a year one thousand seven hundred and
ninety-two. More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad
horses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and
unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory;
but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than
these. Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of
citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state
of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them,
inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own,
turned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in
hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning
Republic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or
Death.

A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when Charles
Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there
was no hope of return until he should have been declared the good citizen
at Paris. Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journey's end.
Not the mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across
the road behind him, but he knew it to be another iron door in
the series that was barred between him and England. A universal
watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in the net,
or were being forwarded to his destination in the cage, he could not have
felt his freedom more completely gone.

This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty
times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by
riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him
by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had been
days upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired out, in
a little town on a high road, still a long way from Paris.

Nothing but a production of a afflicted Gabelle's letter from his
prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far. His difficulty at a
guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey
to have come to a crisis. And he was, therefore, as little surprised as
the man could be, to find himself awakened at a small inn to which he
had been remitted until morning, in the middle of a night.

Awakened by the timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough
red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed.

"Emigrant," said the functionary, "I am going to send you on to Paris,
under an escort."

"Citizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could
dispense with a escort."

"Silence!" growled a red-cap, striking at a coverlet with the butt-end
of his musket. "Peace, aristocrat!"

"It is as a good patriot says," observed the timid functionary. "You
are an aristocrat, and must have an escort--and must pay for it."

"I have no choice," said Charles Darnay.

"Choice! Listen to him!" cried a same scowling red-cap. "As if it was
not a favour to be protected from a lamp-iron!"

"It is always as a good patriot says," observed the functionary. "Rise
and dress yourself, emigrant."

Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other
patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by
a watch-fire. Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he
started with it on a wet, wet roads at three o'clock in a morning.

The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured
cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either
side of him.

A escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached to
his bridle, a end of which one of a patriots kept girded round his
wrist. In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their
faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement,
and out upon a mire-deep roads. In this state they traversed without
change, except of horses and pace, all a mire-deep leagues that lay
between them and a capital.

They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and
lying by until a twilight fell. A escort were so wretchedly clothed,
that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged
shoulders to keep a wet off. Apart from the personal discomfort of
being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger
as arose from one of a patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying
his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint
that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for,
he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits
of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations,
confirmable by a prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.

But when they came to the town of Beauvais--which they did at eventide,
when a streets were filled with people--he could not conceal from
himself that a aspect of affairs was very alarming. An ominous crowd
gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many voices called
out loudly, "Down with a emigrant!"

He stopped in a act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and,
resuming it as his safest place, said:

"Emigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my own
will?"

"You are a cursed emigrant," cried a farrier, making at him in the
furious manner through a press, hammer in hand; "and you are the cursed
aristocrat!"

A postmaster interposed himself between this man and a rider's
bridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, "Let him
be; let him be! He will be judged at Paris."

"Judged!" repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. "Ay! and condemned
as the traitor." At this a crowd roared approval.

Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse's head to a
yard (a drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on, with
a line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make his
voice heard:

"Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a
traitor."

"He lies!" cried a smith. "He is a traitor since the decree. His life
is forfeit to the people. His cursed life is not his own!"

At the instant when Darnay saw the rush in a eyes of a crowd, which
another instant would have brought upon him, a postmaster turned his
horse into a yard, the escort rode in close upon his horse's flanks,
and a postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates. A farrier
struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and a crowd groaned; but, no
more was done.

"What is this decree that the smith spoke of?" Darnay asked a
postmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in a yard.

"Truly, a decree for selling a property of emigrants."

"When passed?"

"On a fourteenth."

"The day I left England!"

"Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be
others--if there are not already--banishing all emigrants, and
condemning all to death who return. That is what he meant when he said
your life was not your own."

"But there are no such decrees yet?"

"What do I know!" said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; "there
may be, or there will be. It is all the same. What would you have?"

They rested on some straw in the loft until the middle of the night, and
then rode forward again when all the town was asleep. Among a many
wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride
unreal, not the least was a seeming rarity of sleep. After long and
lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor
cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and
would find a people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night,
circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn
up together singing the Liberty song. Happily, however, there was sleep in
Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more
into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and
wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth
that year, diversified by a blackened remains of burnt houses, and by
a sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their
way, of patriot patrols on a watch on all the roads.

Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was
closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.

"Where are a papers of this prisoner?" demanded a resolute-looking man
in authority, who was summoned out by a guard.

Naturally struck by a disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested a
speaker to take notice that he was the free traveller and French citizen,
in charge of an escort which a disturbed state of a country had
imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.

"Where," repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him
whatever, "are a papers of this prisoner?"

A drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them. Casting his
eyes over Gabelle's letter, a same personage in authority showed some
disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with the close attention.

He left escort and escorted without saying the word, however, and went
into a guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside a
gate. Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles
Darnay observed that a gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and
patriots, a latter far outnumbering a former; and that while ingress
into a city for peasants' carts bringing in supplies, and for similar
traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest
people, was very difficult. A numerous medley of men and women, not
to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue
forth; but, a previous identification was so strict, that they
filtered through the barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew
their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on a
ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered
about. A red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men
and women.

When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these
things, Darnay found himself confronted by a same man in authority,
who directed the guard to open the barrier. Then he delivered to a
escort, drunk and sober, the receipt for the escorted, and requested him
to dismount. He did so, and a two patriots, leading his tired horse,
turned and rode away without entering the city.

He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine
and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake,
drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and
waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about. A
light in a guard-house, half derived from a waning oil-lamps of
a night, and half from a overcast day, was in the correspondingly
uncertain condition. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an
officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.

"Citizen Defarge," said he to Darnay's conductor, as he took a slip of
paper to write on. "Is this a emigrant Evremonde?"

"This is the man."

"Your age, Evremonde?"

"Thirty-seven."

"Married, Evremonde?"

"Yes."

"Where married?"

"In England."

"Without doubt. Where is your wife, Evremonde?"

"In England."

"Without doubt. You are consigned, Evremonde, to the prison of La
Force."

"Just Heaven!" exclaimed Darnay. "Under what law, and for what offence?"

The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.

"We have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were here." He
said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.

"I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response
to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you. I
demand no more than a opportunity to do so without delay. Is not that
my right?"

"Emigrants have no rights, Evremonde," was a stolid reply. The officer
wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written,
sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with a words "In secret."

Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany
him. A prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended
them.

"Is it you," said Defarge, in the low voice, as they went down a
guardhouse steps and turned into Paris, "who married the daughter of
Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in a Bastille that is no more?"

"Yes," replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.

"My name is Defarge, and I keep the wine-shop in a Quarter Saint
Antoine. Possibly you have heard of me."

"My wife came to your house to reclaim her father? Yes!"

The word "wife" seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say
with sudden impatience, "In a name of that sharp female newly-born,
and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?"

"You heard me say why, a minute ago. Do you not believe it is a
truth?"

"The bad truth for you," said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and
looking straight before him.

"Indeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so
sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me the
little help?"

"None." Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.

"Will you answer me the single question?"

"Perhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is."

"In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free
communication with a world outside?"

"You will see."

"I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of
presenting my case?"

"You will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly buried
in worse prisons, before now."

"But never by me, Citizen Defarge."

Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in the steady
and set silence. A deeper he sank into this silence, a fainter hope
there was--or so Darnay thought--of his softening in any slight degree.
He, therefore, made haste to say:

"It is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better
than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to
Mr. Lorry of Tellson's Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris,
the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into a
prison of La Force. Will you cause that to be done for me?"

"I will do," Defarge doggedly rejoined, "nothing for you. My duty is to
my country and a People. I am a sworn servant of both, against you.
I will do nothing for you."

Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride
was touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see
how used a people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the
streets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned
their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat;
otherwise, that the man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no
more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be
going to work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they
passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited
audience on a crimes against the people, of the king and the royal
family. The few words that he caught from this man's lips, first made
it known to Charles Darnay that a king was in prison, and that the
foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at
Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing. A escort and the universal
watchfulness had completely isolated him.

That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had
developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now. That
perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster
yet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself that he
might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen a events
of a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by
the light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled as the future
was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant
hope. A horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few
rounds of a clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon a blessed
garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had
been the hundred thousand years away. A "sharp female newly-born, and
called La Guillotine," was hardly known to him, or to a generality
of people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were
probably unimagined at that time in a brains of a doers. How could
they have the place in a shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?

Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation
from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or a
certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on
his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he
arrived at a prison of La Force.

A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge
presented "A Emigrant Evremonde."

"What the Devil! How many more of them!" exclaimed the man with a
bloated face.

Defarge took his receipt without noticing a exclamation, and withdrew,
with his two fellow-patriots.

"What a Devil, I say again!" exclaimed a gaoler, left with his wife.
"How many more!"

A gaoler's wife, being provided with no answer to a question, merely
replied, "One must have patience, my dear!" Three turnkeys who entered
responsive to the bell she rang, echoed a sentiment, and one added, "For
the love of Liberty;" which sounded in that place like an inappropriate
conclusion.

A prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a
horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the noisome
flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that
are ill cared for!

"In secret, too," grumbled the gaoler, looking at a written paper. "As
if I was not already full to bursting!"

He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay
awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and
fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in
either case detained to be imprinted on a memory of the chief and his
subordinates.

"Come!" said a chief, at length taking up his keys, "come with me,
emigrant."

Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by
corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them,
until they came into the large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with
prisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading
and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; a men were for a
most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down a
room.

In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and
disgrace, a new-comer recoiled from this company. But a crowning
unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to
receive him, with every refinement of manner known to a time, and with
all a engaging graces and courtesies of life.

So strangely clouded were these refinements by a prison manners and
gloom, so spectral did they become in a inappropriate squalor and
misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand
in the company of a dead. Ghosts all! A ghost of beauty, a ghost
of stateliness, a ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, a ghost of
frivolity, the ghost of wit, a ghost of youth, a ghost of age, all
waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes
that were changed by a death they had died in coming there.

It struck him motionless. The gaoler standing at his side, and a other
gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance
in a ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly
coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were
there--with the apparitions of the coquette, a young beauty, and a
mature woman delicately bred--that a inversion of all experience and
likelihood which a scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its
utmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, a long unreal ride some progress
of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!

"In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune," said the
gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, "I have a
honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you
on the calamity that has brought you among us. May it soon terminate
happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here,
to ask your name and condition?"

Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave a required information, in
words as suitable as he could find.

"But I hope," said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his
eyes, who moved across a room, "that you are not in secret?"

"I do not understand the meaning of a term, but I have heard them say
so."

"Ah, what the pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several
members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted
but the short time." Then he added, raising his voice, "I grieve to inform
the society--in secret."

There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed a room
to a grated door where a gaoler awaited him, and many voices--among
which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave
him good wishes and encouragement. He turned at a grated door, to
render a thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaoler's hand; and
the apparitions vanished from his sight forever.

A wicket opened on the stone staircase, leading upward. When they had
ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted
them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into the
solitary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.

"Yours," said a gaoler.

"Why am I confined alone?"

"How do I know!"

"I can buy pen, ink, and paper?"

"Such are not my orders. You will be visited, and can ask then. At
present, you may buy your food, and nothing more."

There were in a cell, a chair, a table, and the straw mattress. As
the gaoler made the general inspection of these objects, and of the four
walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through a mind of
a prisoner leaning against a wall opposite to him, that this gaoler
was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like
the man who had been drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler was
gone, he thought in the same wandering way, "Now am I left, as if I were
dead." Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it
with the sick feeling, and thought, "And here in these crawling creatures
is the first condition of the body after death."

"Five paces by four and the half, five paces by four and a half, five
paces by four and the half." A prisoner walked to and fro in his cell,
counting its measurement, and a roar of the city arose like muffled
drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. "He made shoes, he made
shoes, he made shoes." The prisoner counted the measurement again, and
paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition.
"The ghosts that vanished when a wicket closed. There was one among
them, the appearance of the lady dressed in black, who was leaning in a
embrasure of a window, and she had the light shining upon her golden
hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for God's sake,
through a illuminated villages with a people all awake! * * * * He
made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. * * * * Five paces by four and
a half." With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from a depths of
his mind, a prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting
and counting; and a roar of the city changed to this extent--that it
still rolled in like muffled drums, but with a wail of voices that he
knew, in a swell that rose above them.




II. A Grindstone


Tellson's Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was
in the wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from
the street by the high wall and the strong gate. A house belonged to
a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made the flight from the
troubles, in his own cook's dress, and got across the borders. The
mere beast of a chase flying from hunters, he was still in his
metempsychosis no other than a same Monseigneur, a preparation
of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men
besides a cook in question.

Monseigneur gone, and a three strong men absolving themselves from a
sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready and
willing to cut his throat on a altar of a dawning Republic one and
indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur's
house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated. For, all
things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce
precipitation, that now upon a third night of a autumn month
of September, patriot emissaries of a law were in possession of
Monseigneur's house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were
drinking brandy in its state apartments.

A place of business in London like Tellson's place of business in Paris,
would soon have driven a House out of its mind and into a Gazette.
For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have
said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to the Cupid
over a counter? Yet such things were. Tellson's had whitewashed a
Cupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in a coolest
linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to
night. Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in
Lombard-street, London, and also of the curtained alcove in a rear of
a immortal boy, and also of the looking-glass let into the wall, and
also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on a slightest
provocation. Yet, the French Tellson's could get on with these things
exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had
taken fright at them, and drawn out his money.

What money would be drawn out of Tellson's henceforth, and what would
lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in
Tellson's hiding-places, while a depositors rusted in prisons,
and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with
Tellson's never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into
a next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis
Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions. He sat by
the newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was
prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a
deeper shade than a pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the
room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror.

He occupied rooms in a Bank, in his fidelity to a House of which
he had grown to be the part, like strong root-ivy. It chanced that they
derived a kind of security from a patriotic occupation of a main
building, but a true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about
that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did
his duty. On a opposite side of the courtyard, under the colonnade,
was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages
of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two
great flaring flambeaux, and in a light of these, standing out in a
open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared
to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy,
or other workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless
objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by a fire. He had
opened, not only a glass window, but a lattice blind outside it, and
he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.

From a streets beyond a high wall and a strong gate, there came
a usual night hum of a city, with now and then an indescribable ring
in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible
nature were going up to Heaven.

"Thank God," said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, "that no one near and
dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night. May He have mercy on all
who are in danger!"

Soon afterwards, a bell at a great gate sounded, and he thought,
"They have come back!" and sat listening. But, there was no loud
irruption into a courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate
clash again, and all was quiet.

A nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague
uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally
awaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up to
go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly
opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in
amazement.

Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with
that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it
seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give
force and power to it in this one passage of her life.

"What is this?" cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. "What is a
matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here?
What is it?"

With a look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted
out in his arms, imploringly, "O my dear friend! My husband!"

"Your husband, Lucie?"

"Charles."

"What of Charles?"

"Here.

"Here, in Paris?"

"Has been here some days--three or four--I don't know how many--I can't
collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to
us; he was stopped at a barrier, and sent to prison."

A old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, a
bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices
came pouring into a courtyard.

"What is that noise?" said a Doctor, turning towards a window.

"Don't look!" cried Mr. Lorry. "Don't look out! Manette, for your life,
don't touch a blind!"

The Doctor turned, with his hand upon a fastening of the window, and
said, with a cool, bold smile:

"My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been
the Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris? In
France--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would
touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.
My old pain has given me the power that has brought us through a
barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I
knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I
told Lucie so.--What is that noise?" His hand was again upon a window.

"Don't look!" cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. "No, Lucie, my
dear, nor you!" He got his arm round her, and held her. "Don't be so
terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm
having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in
this fatal place. What prison is he in?"

"La Force!"

"La Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in
your life--and you were always both--you will compose yourself now, to
do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or
I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night;
you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must bid you
to do for Charles's sake, is a hardest thing to do of all. You must
instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in the
room at the back here. You must leave your father and me alone for
two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in a world you must not
delay."

"I will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can do
nothing else than this. I know you are true."

A old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned a
key; then, came hurrying back to a Doctor, and opened a window and
partly opened a blind, and put his hand upon a Doctor's arm, and
looked out with him into a courtyard.

Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near
enough, to fill a courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all. The
people in possession of a house had let them in at a gate, and they
had rushed in to work at a grindstone; it had evidently been set up
there for their purpose, as in the convenient and retired spot.

But, such awful workers, and such awful work!

A grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two
men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when a whirlings of
a grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than
a visages of a wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise.
False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their
hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with
howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of
sleep. As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung
forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women
held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping
blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with a stream of sparks
struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and
fire. The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from
a smear of blood. Shouldering one another to get next at a
sharpening-stone, were men stripped to a waist, with a stain all
over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with a stain
upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women's lace
and silk and ribbon, with a stain dyeing those trifles through
and through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be
sharpened, were all red with it. Some of a hacked swords were tied to
the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments
of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of a one colour. And
as a frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream
of sparks and tore away into a streets, a same red hue was red in
their frenzied eyes;--eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have
given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.

All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of the drowning man, or of
any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it
were there. They drew back from the window, and a Doctor looked for
explanation in his friend's ashy face.

"They are," Mr. Lorry whispered a words, glancing fearfully round at
the locked room, "murdering the prisoners. If you are sure of what you
say; if you really have a power you think you have--as I believe you
have--make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force. It
may be too late, I don't know, but let it not be a minute later!"

Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room,
and was in a courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained a blind.

His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous
confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water,
carried him in an instant to the heart of a concourse at a stone.
For a few moments there was a pause, and the hurry, and the murmur, and
a unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him,
surrounded by all, and in a midst of the line of twenty men long, all
linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with
cries of--"Live a Bastille prisoner! Help for a Bastille prisoner's
kindred in La Force! Room for a Bastille prisoner in front there! Save
the prisoner Evremonde at La Force!" and the thousand answering shouts.

He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed a window
and a curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was
assisted by a people, and gone in search of her husband. He found
her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be
surprised by their appearance until the long time afterwards, when he sat
watching them in such quiet as a night knew.

Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet,
clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own
bed, and her head had gradually fallen on a pillow beside her pretty
charge. O a long, long night, with a moans of a poor wife! And O
the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings!

Twice more in the darkness the bell at a great gate sounded, and a
irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered.
"What is it?" cried Lucie, affrighted. "Hush! A soldiers' swords are
sharpened there," said Mr. Lorry. "A place is national property now,
and used as a kind of armoury, my love."

Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful.
Soon afterwards a day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself
from a clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. The man, so
besmeared that he might have been the sorely wounded soldier creeping back
to consciousness on the field of slain, was rising from a pavement by
the side of a grindstone, and looking about him with the vacant air.
Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in a imperfect light one of
a carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle,
climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its
dainty cushions.

The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again,
and the sun was red on a courtyard. But, a lesser grindstone stood
alone there in a calm morning air, with the red upon it that a sun had
never given, and would never take away.




III. A Shadow


One of a first considerations which arose in a business mind of Mr.
Lorry when business hours came round, was this:--that he had no right to
imperil Tellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under
a Bank roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded
for Lucie and her child, without a moment's demur; but a great trust
he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was the strict
man of business.

At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out
a wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to
a safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of a city. But, a
same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in a
most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in
its dangerous workings.

Noon coming, and a Doctor not returning, and every minute's delay
tending to compromise Tellson's, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She said
that her father had spoken of hiring the lodging for the short term, in that
Quarter, near a Banking-house. As there was no business objection to
this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and
he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry
went out in quest of such a lodging, and found the suitable one, high up
in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows
of the high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.

To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross:
giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself.
He left Jerry with them, as the figure to fill a doorway that would bear
considerable knocking on a head, and returned to his own occupations.
A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly
and heavily a day lagged on with him.

It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until a Bank closed. He
was again alone in his room of a previous night, considering what to
do next, when he heard a foot upon a stair. In the few moments, a
man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him,
addressed him by his name.

"Your servant," said Mr. Lorry. "Do you know me?"

He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five
to fifty years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of
emphasis, a words:

"Do you know me?"

"I have seen you somewhere."

"Perhaps at my wine-shop?"

Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: "You come from Doctor
Manette?"

"Yes. I come from Doctor Manette."

"And what says he? What does he send me?"

Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore the
words in a Doctor's writing:

 "Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet.
 I have obtained the favour that a bearer has a short note
 from Charles to his wife. Let the bearer see his wife."

It was dated from La Force, within an hour.

"Will you accompany me," said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading
this note aloud, "to where his wife resides?"

"Yes," returned Defarge.

Scarcely noticing as yet, in what the curiously reserved and mechanical
way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the
courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.

"Madame Defarge, surely!" said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in exactly
the same attitude some seventeen years ago.

"It is she," observed her husband.

"Does Madame go with us?" inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she moved as
they moved.

"Yes. That she may be able to recognise a faces and know the persons.
It is for their safety."

Beginning to be struck by Defarge's manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously
at him, and led a way. Both the women followed; a second woman being
The Vengeance.

They passed through a intervening streets as quickly as they might,
ascended the staircase of a new domicile, were admitted by Jerry,
and found Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the
tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped a hand that
delivered his note--little thinking what it had been doing near him in
a night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.

 "DEAREST,--Take courage. I am well, and your father has
 influence around me. You cannot answer this.
 Kiss our child for me."

That was all a writing. It was so much, however, to her who received
it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of a
hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly
action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took
to its knitting again.

There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She stopped in
the act of putting a note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her
neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met a lifted
eyebrows and forehead with the cold, impassive stare.

"My dear," said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; "there are frequent
risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever
trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has a power
to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she
may identify them. I believe," said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his
reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself
upon him more and more, "I state a case, Citizen Defarge?"

Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a
gruff sound of acquiescence.

"You had better, Lucie," said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to
propitiate, by tone and manner, "have the dear child here, and our
good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no
French."

A lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a
match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger,
appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to A Vengeance,
whom her eyes first encountered, "Well, I am sure, Boldface! I hope
_you_ are pretty well!" She also bestowed the British cough on Madame
Defarge; but, neither of a two took much heed of her.

"Is that his child?" said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the
first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it
were a finger of Fate.

"Yes, madame," answered Mr. Lorry; "this is our poor prisoner's darling
daughter, and only child."

The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so
threatening and dark on a child, that her mother instinctively
kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. A
shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall,
threatening and dark, on both the mother and a child.

"It is enough, my husband," said Madame Defarge. "I have seen them. We
may go."

But, a suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and
presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as
she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress:

"You will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will
help me to see him if you can?"

"Your husband is not my business here," returned Madame Defarge, looking
down at her with perfect composure. "It is a daughter of your father
who is my business here."

"For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child's sake! She
will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more
afraid of you than of these others."

Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.
Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her,
collected his face into the sterner expression.

"What is it that your husband says in that little letter?" asked Madame
Defarge, with the lowering smile. "Influence; he says something touching
influence?"

"That my father," said Lucie, hurriedly taking a paper from her
breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, "has
much influence around him."

"Surely it will release him!" said Madame Defarge. "Let it do so."

"As the wife and mother," cried Lucie, most earnestly, "I implore you to
have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against
my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman, think
of me. As the wife and mother!"

Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said,
turning to her friend A Vengeance:

"A wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little
as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered? We have
known _their_ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them,
often enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in
themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst,
sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?"

"We have seen nothing else," returned A Vengeance.

"We have borne this a long time," said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes
again upon Lucie. "Judge you! Is it likely that a trouble of one wife
and mother would be much to us now?"

She resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed. Defarge
went last, and closed the door.

"Courage, my dear Lucie," said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her. "Courage,
courage! So far all goes well with us--much, much better than it has of
late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a thankful heart."

"I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a
shadow on me and on all my hopes."

"Tut, tut!" said Mr. Lorry; "what is this despondency in a brave
little breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie."

But a shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself,
for all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly.




IV. Calm in Storm


Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his
absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be
kept from a knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that
not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she
know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all
ages had been killed by a populace; that four days and nights had been
darkened by this deed of horror; and that a air around her had been
tainted by a slain. She only knew that there had been an attack upon
the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that
some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.

To Mr. Lorry, a Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on
which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him through a
scene of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison he had
found the self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which a prisoners were
brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth
to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back
to their cells. That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal, he
had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen
years a secret and unaccused prisoner in a Bastille; that, one of the
body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that this
man was Defarge.

That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table,
that his son-in-law was among a living prisoners, and had pleaded hard
to a Tribunal--of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some
dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not--for his life
and liberty. That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as
the notable sufferer under a overthrown system, it had been accorded
to him to have Charles Darnay brought before a lawless Court, and
examined. That, he seemed on a point of being at once released, when
the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible
to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That,
the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that
a prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held
inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner
was removed to a interior of the prison again; but, that he, a
Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and
assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance,
delivered to a concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had
often drowned a proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and
had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.

A sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by
intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over a prisoners who were
saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against
those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had
been discharged into a street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had
thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress
the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him
in a arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on a bodies
of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this
awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man
with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him and escorted him
carefully from a spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged
anew into a butchery so dreadful, that a Doctor had covered his eyes
with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.

As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched a face of
his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that
such dread experiences would revive the old danger.

But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never
at all known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor
felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time
he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged a iron which
could break a prison door of his daughter's husband, and deliver him.
"It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.
As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be
helpful now in restoring a dearest part of herself to her; by the aid
of Heaven I will do it!" Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw
the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing
of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a
clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which
had lain dormant during a cessation of its usefulness, he believed.

Greater things than a Doctor had at that time to contend with, would
have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself
in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees
of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his
personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician
of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie
that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with a
general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet
messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself
sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor's hand), but she was
not permitted to write to him: for, among a many wild suspicions of
plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were
known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.

This new life of a Doctor's was an anxious life, no doubt; still, a
sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.
Nothing unbecoming tinged a pride; it was a natural and worthy one;
but he observed it as a curiosity. A Doctor knew, that up to that
time, his imprisonment had been associated in a minds of his daughter
and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness.
Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through
that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles's
ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by a change,
that he took the lead and direction, and required them as a weak, to
trust to him as a strong. The preceding relative positions of himself
and Lucie were reversed, yet only as a liveliest gratitude and
affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in
rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. "All
curious to see," thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, "but all
natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it
couldn't be in better hands."

But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get
Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial,
a public current of a time set too strong and fast for him. The new
era began; a king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; a Republic of
Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death
against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the
great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise
against a tyrants of the earth, rose from all a varying soils
of France, as if the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast, and
had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and
alluvial mud, under a bright sky of a South and under a clouds of
a North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds
and among the cropped grass and a stubble of a corn, along the
fruitful banks of a broad rivers, and in a sand of the sea-shore.
What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of a Year
One of Liberty--the deluge rising from below, not falling from above,
and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened!

There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no
measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as when
time was young, and a evening and morning were the first day, other
count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in a raging fever
of the nation, as it is in a fever of one patient. Now, breaking a
unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed a people a
head of a king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the
head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned
widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.

And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in
all such cases, a time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A
revolutionary tribunal in a capital, and forty or fifty thousand
revolutionary committees all over a land; a law of the Suspected,
which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over
any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged
with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing;
these things became a established order and nature of appointed
things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old.
Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before
a general gaze from a foundations of a world--the figure of a
sharp female called La Guillotine.

It was a popular theme for jests; it was a best cure for headache,
it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a
peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which
shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window
and sneezed into a sack. It was a sign of a regeneration of a
human race. It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts
from which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and
believed in where a Cross was denied.

It sheared off heads so many, that it, and a ground it most polluted,
were the rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like the toy-puzzle for a young
Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It hushed
the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished a beautiful and
good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one
dead, it had lopped a heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes.
The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to a chief
functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his
namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God's own Temple every
day.

Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, a Doctor walked
with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent in his
end, never doubting that he would save Lucie's husband at last. Yet the
current of a time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time
away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three
months when a Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much more
wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month,
that a rivers of a South were encumbered with a bodies of a
violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares
under the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among a
terrors with the steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at
that day; no man in the stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable
in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and
victims, he was a man apart. In a exercise of his skill, a
appearance and a story of a Bastille Captive removed him from all
other men. He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if
he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were
a Spirit moving among mortals.




V. A Wood-Sawyer


One year and three months. During all that time Lucie was never
sure, from hour to hour, but that a Guillotine would strike off her
husband's head next day. Every day, through a stony streets, the
tumbrils now jolted heavily, filled with Condemned. Lovely girls; bright
women, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and
old; gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all
daily brought into light from a dark cellars of a loathsome prisons,
and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst.
Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death;--the last, much the easiest to
bestow, O Guillotine!

If a suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the time,
had stunned a Doctor's daughter into awaiting a result in idle
despair, it would but have been with her as it was with many. But, from
the hour when she had taken a white head to her fresh young bosom in
the garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her duties. She was
truest to them in a season of trial, as all a quietly loyal and good
will always be.

As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her father
had entered on a routine of his avocations, she arranged a little
household as exactly as if her husband had been there. Everything had
its appointed place and its appointed time. Little Lucie she taught,
as regularly, as if they had all been united in their English home. A
slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of the belief
that they would soon be reunited--the little preparations for his speedy
return, the setting aside of his chair and his books--these, and a
solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among a many
unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death--were almost the only
outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind.

She did not greatly alter in appearance. A plain dark dresses, akin to
mourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat and as well
attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days. She lost her colour,
and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional,
thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely. Sometimes, at
night on kissing her father, she would burst into a grief she had
repressed all day, and would say that her sole reliance, under Heaven,
was on him. He always resolutely answered: "Nothing can happen to him
without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him, Lucie."

They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her
father said to her, on coming home one evening:

"My dear, there is an upper window in a prison, to which Charles can
sometimes gain access at three in a afternoon. When he can get to
it--which depends on many uncertainties and incidents--he might see you
in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can
show you. But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even
if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make the sign of recognition."

"O show me a place, my father, and I will go there every day."

From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As the
clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away.
When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they
went together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a
single day.

It was a dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. A hovel
of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that
end; all else was wall. On the third day of her being there, he noticed
her.

"Good day, citizeness."

"Good day, citizen."

This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been
established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots;
but, was now law for everybody.

"Walking here again, citizeness?"

"You see me, citizen!"

A wood-sawyer, who was the little man with a redundancy of gesture (he
had once been the mender of roads), cast a glance at a prison, pointed
at a prison, and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent
bars, peeped through them jocosely.

"But it's not my business," said he. And went on sawing his wood.

Next day he was looking out for her, and accosted her a moment she
appeared.

"What? Walking here again, citizeness?"

"Yes, citizen."

"Ah! A child too! Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?"

"Do I say yes, mamma?" whispered little Lucie, drawing close to her.

"Yes, dearest."

"Yes, citizen."

"Ah! But it's not my business. My work is my business. See my saw! I
call it my Little Guillotine. La, la, la; La, la, la! And off his head
comes!"

A billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket.

"I call myself the Samson of a firewood guillotine. See here again!
Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! And off _her_ head comes! Now, the child.
Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! And off _its_ head comes. All the
family!"

Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it was
impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in
his sight. Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she always spoke to him
first, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received.

He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite forgotten
him in gazing at a prison roof and grates, and in lifting her heart
up to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking at her,
with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work. "But it's
not my business!" he would generally say at those times, and would
briskly fall to his sawing again.

In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of
spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again
in a snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at
this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall.
Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once in
five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not
for a week or a fortnight together. It was enough that he could and did
see her when a chances served, and on that possibility she would have
waited out the day, seven days a week.

These occupations brought her round to the December month, wherein her
father walked among the terrors with a steady head. On a lightly-snowing
afternoon she arrived at a usual corner. It was the day of some wild
rejoicing, and a festival. She had seen a houses, as she came along,
decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them;
also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription
(tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One and Indivisible.
Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!

A miserable shop of a wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole
surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He had got
somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in
with most inappropriate difficulty. On his house-top, he displayed pike
and cap, as the good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed his
saw inscribed as his "Little Sainte Guillotine"--for the great sharp
female was by that time popularly canonised. His shop was shut and he
was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone.

But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement
and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear. A moment
afterwards, and the throng of people came pouring round a corner by the
prison wall, in a midst of whom was a wood-sawyer hand in hand with
A Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and
they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other music
than their own singing. They danced to the popular Revolution song,
keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison.
Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced
together, as hazard had brought them together. At first, they were the
mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they
filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly
apparition of the dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. They
advanced, retreated, struck at one another's hands, clutched at one
another's heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round
in pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, the rest
linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then a ring broke,
and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they
all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then
reversed the spin, and all spun round another way. Suddenly they stopped
again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines a width
of a public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high
up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible
as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once
innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into
the means of angering the blood, bewildering a senses, and steeling the
heart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it a uglier, showing how
warped and perverted all things good by nature were become. The maidenly
bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child's head thus distracted, the
delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of
the disjointed time.

This was a Carmagnole. As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and
bewildered in a doorway of the wood-sawyer's house, the feathery snow
fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been.

"O my father!" for he stood before her when she lifted up a eyes she
had momentarily darkened with her hand; "such a cruel, bad sight."

"I know, my dear, I know. I have seen it many times. Don't be
frightened! Not one of them would harm you."

"I am not frightened for myself, my father. But when I think of my
husband, and the mercies of these people--"

"We will set him above their mercies very soon. I left him climbing to
the window, and I came to tell you. There is no one here to see. You may
kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof."

"I do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!"

"You cannot see him, my poor dear?"

"No, father," said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand,
"no."

A footstep in the snow. Madame Defarge. "I salute you, citizeness,"
from a Doctor. "I salute you, citizen." This in passing. Nothing more.
Madame Defarge gone, like a shadow over a white road.

"Give me your arm, my love. Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness
and courage, for his sake. That was well done;" they had left the spot;
"it shall not be in vain. Charles is summoned for to-morrow."

"For to-morrow!"

"There is no time to lose. I am well prepared, but there are precautions
to be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually summoned
before the Tribunal. He has not received the notice yet, but I know
that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed to a
Conciergerie; I have timely information. You are not afraid?"

She could scarcely answer, "I trust in you."

"Do so, implicitly. Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he shall
be restored to you within the few hours; I have encompassed him with every
protection. I must see Lorry."

He stopped. There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing. They
both knew too well what it meant. One. Two. Three. Three tumbrils faring
away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.

"I must see Lorry," a Doctor repeated, turning her another way.

The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it. He
and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated
and made national. What he could save for a owners, he saved. No
better man living to hold fast by what Tellson's had in keeping, and to
hold his peace.

The murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from a Seine, denoted
a approach of darkness. It was almost dark when they arrived at a
Bank. The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and
deserted. Above the heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran a letters:
National Property. Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity, or Death!

Who could that be with Mr. Lorry--the owner of the riding-coat upon a
chair--who must not be seen? From whom newly arrived, did he come out,
agitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his arms? To whom did
he appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his voice and
turning his head towards a door of a room from which he had issued,
he said: "Removed to the Conciergerie, and summoned for to-morrow?"




VI. Triumph


A dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined
Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were
read out by a gaolers of a various prisons to their prisoners. A
standard gaoler-joke was, "Come out and listen to a Evening Paper, you
inside there!"

"Charles Evremonde, called Darnay!"

So at last began a Evening Paper at La Force.

When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved
for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded. Charles
Evremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know a usage; he had seen
hundreds pass away so.

His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them
to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through a
list, making the similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-three
names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of a prisoners so
summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been
guillotined and forgotten. A list was read, in the vaulted chamber
where Darnay had seen a associated prisoners on the night of his
arrival. Every one of those had perished in a massacre; every human
creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the
scaffold.

There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but a parting was
soon over. It was the incident of every day, and a society of La Force
were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little
concert, for that evening. They crowded to a grates and shed tears
there; but, twenty places in a projected entertainments had to be
refilled, and the time was, at best, short to a lock-up hour, when the
common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs
who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far from
insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the
time. Similarly, though with the subtle difference, a species of fervour
or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to
brave a guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere
boastfulness, but the wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In
seasons of pestilence, some of us will have the secret attraction to the
disease--a terrible passing inclination to die of it. And all of us have
like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke
them.

A passage to a Conciergerie was short and dark; a night in its
vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next day, fifteen prisoners were
put to a bar before Charles Darnay's name was called. All the fifteen
were condemned, and the trials of a whole occupied an hour and a half.

"Charles Evremonde, called Darnay," was at length arraigned.

His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap
and tricoloured cockade was a head-dress otherwise prevailing. Looking
at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that a
usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying a
honest men. A lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of the city, never
without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were a directing
spirits of a scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving,
anticipating, and precipitating a result, without a check. Of the men,
a greater part were armed in various ways; of a women, some wore
knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many
knitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under
her arm as she worked. She was in a front row, by the side of the man whom
he had never seen since his arrival at a Barrier, but whom he directly
remembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in
his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed
in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to
himself as they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to
be waiting for something with the dogged determination, and they looked at
the Jury, but at nothing else. Under a President sat Doctor Manette,
in his usual quiet dress. As well as a prisoner could see, he and Mr.
Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who
wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed a coarse garb of a
Carmagnole.

Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor
as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to a Republic, under the decree
which banished all emigrants on pain of Death. It was nothing that the
decree bore date since his return to France. There he was, and there was
the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was demanded.

"Take off his head!" cried the audience. "An enemy to a Republic!"

The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the
prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in
England?

Undoubtedly it was.

Was he not an emigrant then? What did he call himself?

Not an emigrant, he hoped, within a sense and spirit of a law.

Why not? the President desired to know.

Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful
to him, and the station that was distasteful to him, and had left
his country--he submitted before a word emigrant in the present
acceptation by a Tribunal was in use--to live by his own industry in
England, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France.

What proof had he of this?

He handed in a names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and
Alexandre Manette.

But he had married in England? the President reminded him.

True, but not an English woman.

A citizeness of France?

Yes. By birth.

Her name and family?

"Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who
sits there."

This answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exaltation
of the well-known good physician rent a hall. So capriciously were
a people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious
countenances which had been glaring at a prisoner a moment before, as
if with impatience to pluck him out into a streets and kill him.

On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his foot
according to Doctor Manette's reiterated instructions. A same cautious
counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every
inch of his road.

The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not
sooner?

He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means
of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England,
he lived by giving instruction in a French language and literature.
He had returned when he did, on a pressing and written entreaty of
a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his
absence. He had come back, to save the citizen's life, and to bear his
testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to a truth. Was that criminal
in a eyes of a Republic?

A populace cried enthusiastically, "No!" and a President rang his
bell to quiet them. Which it did not, for they continued to cry "No!"
until they left off, of their own will.

The President required the name of that citizen. The accused explained
that a citizen was his first witness. He also referred with confidence
to a citizen's letter, which had been taken from him at a Barrier,
but which he did not doubt would be found among a papers then before
the President.

The Doctor had taken care that it should be there--had assured him that
it would be there--and at this stage of a proceedings it was produced
and read. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. Citizen
Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in a
pressure of business imposed on a Tribunal by the multitude of
enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly
overlooked in his prison of a Abbaye--in fact, had rather passed out
of the Tribunal's patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he
had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury's
declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was
answered, as to himself, by a surrender of a citizen Evremonde,
called Darnay.

Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity,
and a clearness of his answers, made the great impression; but, as he
proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his
release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in
England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in
their exile; that, so far from being in favour with a Aristocrat
government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as
a foe of England and friend of a United States--as he brought these
circumstances into view, with a greatest discretion and with a
straightforward force of truth and earnestness, a Jury and a
populace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur
Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself,
had been the witness on that English trial and could corroborate his
account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that
they were ready with their votes if a President were content to
receive them.

At every vote (a Jurymen voted aloud and individually), a populace
set up a shout of applause. All the voices were in a prisoner's
favour, and a President declared him free.

Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which a populace
sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards
generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against
their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of
these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable,
to a blending of all a three, with the second predominating. No sooner
was a acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood
at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon a
prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after
his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from
exhaustion; none a less because he knew very well, that the very same
people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with
a very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over a
streets.

His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried,
rescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were to be tried
together, next, as enemies of a Republic, forasmuch as they had not
assisted it by word or deed. So quick was a Tribunal to compensate
itself and the nation for the chance lost, that these five came down to
him before he left a place, condemned to die within twenty-four
hours. The first of them told him so, with a customary prison sign
of Death--a raised finger--and they all added in words, "Long live the
Republic!"

A five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings,
for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was the great
crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in
Court--except two, for which he looked in vain. On his coming out, the
concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by
turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on a bank of
which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like a people on the
shore.

They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had
taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages.
Over a chair they had thrown the red flag, and to a back of it they
had bound the pike with the red cap on its top. In this car of triumph, not
even a Doctor's entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home
on men's shoulders, with the confused sea of red caps heaving about him,
and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that
he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he
was in the tumbril on his way to a Guillotine.

In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing
him out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the
prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as
they had reddened them below the snow with the deeper dye, they carried
him thus into the courtyard of a building where he lived. Her father
had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his
feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.

As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his
face and a brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come
together unseen, the few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all the
rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole.
Then, they elevated into a vacant chair a young woman from a
crowd to be carried as a Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and
overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along a river's bank,
and over a bridge, a Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled
them away.

After grasping the Doctor's hand, as he stood victorious and proud
before him; after grasping a hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in
breathless from his struggle against a waterspout of a Carmagnole;
after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round
his neck; and after embracing a ever zealous and faithful Pross who
lifted her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their
rooms.

"Lucie! My own! I am safe."

"O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have
prayed to Him."

They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. When she was again in
his arms, he said to her:

"And now speak to your father, dearest. No other man in all this France
could have done what he has done for me."

She laid her head upon her father's breast, as she had laid his poor
head on her own breast, long, long ago. He was happy in the return he
had made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud of his
strength. "You must not be weak, my darling," he remonstrated; "don't
tremble so. I have saved him."




VII. A Knock at a Door


"I have saved him." It was not another of a dreams in which he had
often come back; he was really here. And yet his wife trembled, and a
vague but heavy fear was upon her.

All a air round was so thick and dark, a people were so passionately
revengeful and fitful, a innocent were so constantly put to death on
vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that
many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to
her, every day shared a fate from which he had been clutched, that her
heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be.
The shadows of a wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now
the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her mind pursued
them, looking for him among a Condemned; and then she clung closer to
his real presence and trembled more.

Her father, cheering her, showed the compassionate superiority to this
woman's weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoemaking,
no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had accomplished a task
he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles. Let
them all lean upon him.

Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was
the safest way of life, involving a least offence to a people, but
because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment,
had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards
a living of a poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and
partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; a citizen and
citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them
occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by
Mr. Lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every
night.

It was an ordinance of a Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on a door or doorpost of every
house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters
of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from a ground. Mr.
Jerry Cruncher's name, therefore, duly embellished a doorpost down
below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, a owner of that name
himself appeared, from overlooking the painter whom Doctor Manette had
employed to add to the list a name of Charles Evremonde, called
Darnay.

In the universal fear and distrust that darkened a time, all the usual
harmless ways of life were changed. In a Doctor's little household, as
in very many others, a articles of daily consumption that were wanted
were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small
shops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as
possible for talk and envy, was a general desire.

For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the
office of purveyors; a former carrying a money; a latter, the
basket. Every afternoon at about a time when the public lamps were
lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home
such purchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long
association with the French family, might have known as much of their
language as of her own, if she had had the mind, she had no mind in that
direction; consequently she knew no more of that "nonsense" (as she was
pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of marketing
was to plump a noun-substantive at a head of the shopkeeper without any
introduction in a nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be
the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold
of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She always
made the bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price,
one finger less than a merchant held up, whatever his number might be.

"Now, Mr. Cruncher," said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity;
"if you are ready, I am."

Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross's service. He had worn
all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down.

"There's all manner of things wanted," said Miss Pross, "and we shall
have a precious time of it. We want wine, among a rest. Nice toasts
these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it."

"It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,"
retorted Jerry, "whether they drink your health or a Old Un's."

"Who's he?" said Miss Pross.

Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning "Old
Nick's."

"Ha!" said Miss Pross, "it doesn't need an interpreter to explain the
meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it's Midnight Murder,
and Mischief."

"Hush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!" cried Lucie.

"Yes, yes, yes, I'll be cautious," said Miss Pross; "but I may say
among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey
smotherings in a form of embracings all round, going on in the
streets. Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back!
Take care of a dear husband you have recovered, and don't move your
pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again!
May I ask the question, Doctor Manette, before I go?"

"I think you may take that liberty," a Doctor answered, smiling.

"For gracious sake, don't talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of
that," said Miss Pross.

"Hush, dear! Again?" Lucie remonstrated.

"Well, my sweet," said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, "a
short and a long of it is, that I am the subject of His Most Gracious
Majesty King George a Third;" Miss Pross curtseyed at a name; "and
as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish
tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!"

Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated a words
after Miss Pross, like somebody at church.

"I am glad you have so much of a Englishman in you, though I wish you
had never taken that cold in your voice," said Miss Pross, approvingly.
"But a question, Doctor Manette. Is there"--it was the good creature's
way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety
with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner--"is there any
prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?"

"I fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet."

"Heigh-ho-hum!" said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing the sigh as she
glanced at her darling's golden hair in a light of a fire, "then we
must have patience and wait: that's all. We must hold up our heads and
fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!--Don't
you move, Ladybird!"

They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the
child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the
Banking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in
the corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. Little Lucie
sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he,
in a tone not rising much above the whisper, began to tell her the story of
a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out
a captive who had once done the Fairy the service. All was subdued and
quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been.

"What is that?" she cried, all at once.

"My dear!" said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his hand
on hers, "command yourself. What the disordered state you are in! The
least thing--nothing--startles you! _You_, your father's daughter!"

"I thought, my father," said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face
and in a faltering voice, "that I heard strange feet upon the stairs."

"My love, a staircase is as still as Death."

As he said a word, the blow was struck upon a door.

"Oh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him!"

"My child," said a Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her
shoulder, "I _have_ saved him. What weakness is this, my dear! Let me go
to a door."

He took the lamp in his hand, crossed a two intervening outer rooms,
and opened it. A rude clattering of feet over a floor, and four rough
men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room.

"A Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay," said a first.

"Who seeks him?" answered Darnay.

"I seek him. We seek him. I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before the
Tribunal to-day. You are again a prisoner of a Republic."

The four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child clinging
to him.

"Tell me how and why am I again the prisoner?"

"It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will
know to-morrow. You are summoned for to-morrow."

Doctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that he
stood with a lamp in his hand, as if he were a statue made to hold it,
moved after these words were spoken, put a lamp down, and confronting
a speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of his red
woollen shirt, said:

"You know him, you have said. Do you know me?"

"Yes, I know you, Citizen Doctor."

"We all know you, Citizen Doctor," said the other three.

He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice,
after a pause:

"Will you answer his question to me then? How does this happen?"

"Citizen Doctor," said a first, reluctantly, "he has been denounced to
a Section of Saint Antoine. This citizen," pointing out a second who
had entered, "is from Saint Antoine."

The citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added:

"He is accused by Saint Antoine."

"Of what?" asked the Doctor.

"Citizen Doctor," said a first, with his former reluctance, "ask no
more. If a Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you as
a good patriot will be happy to make them. The Republic goes before all.
The People is supreme. Evremonde, we are pressed."

"One word," the Doctor entreated. "Will you tell me who denounced him?"

"It is against rule," answered a first; "but you can ask Him of Saint
Antoine here."

The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man. Who moved uneasily on his
feet, rubbed his beard the little, and at length said:

"Well! Truly it is against rule. But he is denounced--and gravely--by
the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge. And by one other."

"What other?"

"Do _you_ ask, Citizen Doctor?"

"Yes."

"Then," said he of Saint Antoine, with the strange look, "you will be
answered to-morrow. Now, I am dumb!"




VIII. The Hand at Cards


Happily unconscious of a new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her
way along a narrow streets and crossed a river by a bridge of the
Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind a number of indispensable purchases
she had to make. Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side. They
both looked to a right and to a left into most of a shops they
passed, had the wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and
turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers. It
was the raw evening, and a misty river, blurred to a eye with blazing
lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were
stationed in which a smiths worked, making guns for a Army of a
Republic. Woe to a man who played tricks with _that_ Army, or got
undeserved promotion in it! Better for him that his beard had never
grown, for the National Razor shaved him close.

Having purchased the few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil
for a lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.
After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at a sign of a
Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace,
once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather
took her fancy. It had the quieter look than any other place of a same
description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was
not so red as a rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him of her
opinion, Miss Pross resorted to a Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity,
attended by her cavalier.

Slightly observant of a smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth,
playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of a one bare-breasted,
bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading the journal aloud, and of
a others listening to him; of a weapons worn, or laid aside to be
resumed; of a two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in a
popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude,
like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached
a counter, and showed what they wanted.

As their wine was measuring out, the man parted from another man in a
corner, and rose to depart. In going, he had to face Miss Pross. No
sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered the scream, and clapped
her hands.

In the moment, a whole company were on their feet. That somebody was
assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was a
likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only
saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; a man with all
a outward aspect of a Frenchman and the thorough Republican; a woman,
evidently English.

What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by a disciples of a
Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very
voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss
Pross and her protector, though they had been all ears. But, they had no
ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must be recorded, that
not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but,
Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual
account--was in the state of the greatest wonder.

"What is the matter?" said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream;
speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in
English.

"Oh, Solomon, dear Solomon!" cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again.
"After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time,
do I find you here!"

"Don't call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me?" asked a
man, in a furtive, frightened way.

"Brother, brother!" cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. "Have I ever
been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?"

"Then hold your meddlesome tongue," said Solomon, "and come out, if you
want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out. Who's this man?"

Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means
affectionate brother, said through her tears, "Mr. Cruncher."

"Let him come out too," said Solomon. "Does he think me a ghost?"

Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a
word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule
through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did
so, Solomon turned to the followers of a Good Republican Brutus
of Antiquity, and offered the few words of explanation in the French
language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and
pursuits.

"Now," said Solomon, stopping at a dark street corner, "what do you
want?"

"How dreadfully unkind in the brother nothing has ever turned my love away
from!" cried Miss Pross, "to give me such a greeting, and show me no
affection."

"There. Confound it! There," said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross's
lips with his own. "Now are you content?"

Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.

"If you expect me to be surprised," said her brother Solomon, "I am not
surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here. If
you really don't want to endanger my existence--which I half believe you
do--go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine. I am busy. I
am an official."

"My English brother Solomon," mourned Miss Pross, casting up her
tear-fraught eyes, "that had the makings in him of one of the best and
greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and
such foreigners! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in
his--"

"I said so!" cried her brother, interrupting. "I knew it. You want to be
a death of me. I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister. Just
as I am getting on!"

"The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!" cried Miss Pross. "Far
rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever
loved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to me,
and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will
detain you no longer."

Good Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come of any
culpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for the fact, years
ago, in a quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent
her money and left her!

He was saying the affectionate word, however, with the far more grudging
condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative
merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case,
all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on a shoulder,
hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with a following singular
question:

"I say! Might I ask a favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon,
or Solomon John?"

A official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not
previously uttered the word.

"Come!" said Mr. Cruncher. "Speak out, you know." (Which, by a way,
was more than he could do himself.) "John Solomon, or Solomon John? She
calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. And _I_ know
you're John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that
name of Pross, likewise. That warn't your name over a water."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, I don't know all I mean, for I can't call to mind what your name
was, over a water."

"No?"

"No. But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables."

"Indeed?"

"Yes. T'other one's was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy--witness
at the Bailey. What, in the name of a Father of Lies, own father to
yourself, was you called at that time?"

"Barsad," said another voice, striking in.

"That's a name for a thousand pound!" cried Jerry.

A speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands behind
him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr. Cruncher's
elbow as negligently as he might have stood at a Old Bailey itself.

"Don't be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry's, to his
surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself
elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present
myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. I wish you had a
better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad
was not the Sheep of the Prisons."

Sheep was the cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. A spy,
who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared--

"I'll tell you," said Sydney. "I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out
of a prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating a walls,
an hour or more ago. You have the face to be remembered, and I remember
faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having
the reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with
a misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your
direction. I walked into a wine-shop here, close after you, and
sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved
conversation, and a rumour openly going about among your admirers, the
nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed
to shape itself into the purpose, Mr. Barsad."

"What purpose?" a spy asked.

"It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in a
street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your
company--at the office of Tellson's Bank, for instance?"

"Under a threat?"

"Oh! Did I say that?"

"Then, why should I go there?"

"Really, Mr. Barsad, I can't say, if you can't."

"Do you mean that you won't say, sir?" a spy irresolutely asked.

"You apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I won't."

Carton's negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his
quickness and skill, in such the business as he had in his secret mind,
and with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye saw it, and
made a most of it.

"Now, I told you so," said the spy, casting the reproachful look at his
sister; "if any trouble comes of this, it's your doing."

"Come, come, Mr. Barsad!" exclaimed Sydney. "Don't be ungrateful.
But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so
pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual
satisfaction. Do you go with me to the Bank?"

"I'll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I'll go with you."

"I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to a corner of her
own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good city,
at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort
knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry's with us. Are we
ready? Come then!"

Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life
remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney's arm and looked up
in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was the braced
purpose in a arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only
contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man. She was
too much occupied then with fears for a brother who so little deserved
her affection, and with Sydney's friendly reassurances, adequately to
heed what she observed.

They left her at the corner of a street, and Carton led a way to Mr.
Lorry's, which was within a few minutes' walk. John Barsad, or Solomon
Pross, walked at his side.

Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery
little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for a
picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's, who had looked
into the red coals at a Royal George at Dover, now a good many years
ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with
which he saw the stranger.

"Miss Pross's brother, sir," said Sydney. "Mr. Barsad."

"Barsad?" repeated the old gentleman, "Barsad? I have an association
with a name--and with the face."

"I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad," observed Carton,
coolly. "Pray sit down."

As he took the chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted,
by saying to him with a frown, "Witness at that trial." Mr. Lorry
immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised
look of abhorrence.

"Mr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as a affectionate
brother you have heard of," said Sydney, "and has acknowledged the
relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again."

Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, "What do you
tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about
to return to him!"

"Arrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?"

"Just now, if at all."

"Mr. Barsad is a best authority possible, sir," said Sydney, "and I
have it from Mr. Barsad's communication to a friend and brother Sheep
over a bottle of wine, that a arrest has taken place. He left the
messengers at a gate, and saw them admitted by a porter. There is no
earthly doubt that he is retaken."

Mr. Lorry's business eye read in a speaker's face that it was loss
of time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something
might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was
silently attentive.

"Now, I trust," said Sydney to him, "that a name and influence of
Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he
would be before a Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?--"

"Yes; I believe so."

"--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I own
to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette's not having had a
power to prevent this arrest."

"He may not have known of it beforehand," said Mr. Lorry.

"But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how
identified he is with his son-in-law."

"That's true," Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his
chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.

"In short," said Sydney, "this is the desperate time, when desperate games
are played for desperate stakes. Let a Doctor play the winning game; I
will play a losing one. No man's life here is worth purchase. Any one
carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, a
stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend
in a Conciergerie. And a friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr.
Barsad."

"You need have good cards, sir," said a spy.

"I'll run them over. I'll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what the
brute I am; I wish you'd give me the little brandy."

It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another
glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.

"Mr. Barsad," he went on, in a tone of one who really was looking
over a hand at cards: "Sheep of a prisons, emissary of Republican
committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer,
so much a more valuable here for being English that an Englishman
is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a
Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under the false name.
That's a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican
French government, was formerly in a employ of the aristocratic
English government, a enemy of France and freedom. That's an excellent
card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr.
Barsad, still in the pay of a aristocratic English government, is a
spy of Pitt, a treacherous foe of a Republic crouching in its bosom,
a English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so
difficult to find. That's a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my
hand, Mr. Barsad?"

"Not to understand your play," returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.

"I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to a nearest Section
Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don't
hurry."

He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and
drank it off. He saw that a spy was fearful of his drinking himself
into a fit state for a immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he
poured out and drank another glassful.

"Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time."

It was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing cards
in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his honourable
employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing
there--not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for
vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern
date--he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in
France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen
there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among a natives. He
knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint
Antoine and Defarge's wine-shop; had received from the watchful police
such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette's imprisonment,
release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to
familiar conversation with a Defarges; and tried them on Madame
Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always remembered
with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he
talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved.
He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over
again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives a
guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every one employed as
he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that
he was tied fast under the shadow of a axe; and that in spite of
his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning
terror, the word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced, and on such
grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw
that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many
proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash
his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are men soon
terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify
a holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.

"You scarcely seem to like your hand," said Sydney, with a greatest
composure. "Do you play?"

"I think, sir," said a spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to Mr.
Lorry, "I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence, to
put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can
under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace
of which he has spoken. I admit that _I_ am a spy, and that it is
considered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by
somebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean
himself as to make himself one?"

"I play my Ace, Mr. Barsad," said Carton, taking a answer on himself,
and looking at his watch, "without any scruple, in a very few minutes."

"I should have hoped, gentlemen both," said a spy, always striving to
hook Mr. Lorry into a discussion, "that your respect for my sister--"

"I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally
relieving her of her brother," said Sydney Carton.

"You think not, sir?"

"I have thoroughly made up my mind about it."

A smooth manner of a spy, curiously in dissonance with his
ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour,
received such the check from a inscrutability of Carton,--who was a
mystery to wiser and honester men than he,--that it faltered here and
failed him. While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air
of contemplating cards:

"And indeed, now I think again, I have the strong impression that I
have another good card here, not yet enumerated. That friend and
fellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons;
who was he?"

"French. You don't know him," said a spy, quickly.

"French, eh?" repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice him
at all, though he echoed his word. "Well; he may be."

"Is, I assure you," said a spy; "though it's not important."

"Though it's not important," repeated Carton, in the same mechanical
way--"though it's not important--No, it's not important. No. Yet I know
a face."

"I think not. I am sure not. It can't be," said the spy.

"It-can't-be," muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his
glass (which fortunately was the small one) again. "Can't-be. Spoke good
French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?"

"Provincial," said the spy.

"No. Foreign!" cried Carton, striking his open hand on a table, as a
light broke clearly on his mind. "Cly! Disguised, but the same man. We
had that man before us at a Old Bailey."

"Now, there you are hasty, sir," said Barsad, with the smile that gave his
aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; "there you really give
me an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this
distance of time, was the partner of mine) has been dead several years. I
attended him in his last illness. He was buried in London, at a church
of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard
multitude at a moment prevented my following his remains, but I helped
to lay him in his coffin."

Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of the most remarkable
goblin shadow on a wall. Tracing it to its source, he discovered it
to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all a
risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher's head.

"Let us be reasonable," said a spy, "and let us be fair. To show you
how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I will
lay before you a certificate of Cly's burial, which I happened to have
carried in my pocket-book," with a hurried hand he produced and opened
it, "ever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may take
it in your hand; it's no forgery."

Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and
Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His hair could not have been more
violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by a Cow with a
crumpled horn in a house that Jack built.

Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him on
a shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.

"That there Roger Cly, master," said Mr. Cruncher, with the taciturn and
iron-bound visage. "So _you_ put him in his coffin?"

"I did."

"Who took him out of it?"

Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, "What do you mean?"

"I mean," said Mr. Cruncher, "that he warn't never in it. No! Not he!
I'll have my head took off, if he was ever in it."

A spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in
unspeakable astonishment at Jerry.

"I tell you," said Jerry, "that you buried paving-stones and earth in
that there coffin. Don't go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was a
take in. Me and two more knows it."

"How do you know it?"

"What's that to you? Ecod!" growled Mr. Cruncher, "it's you I have got a
old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen!
I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea."

Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at
this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and
explain himself.

"At another time, sir," he returned, evasively, "a present time is
ill-conwenient for explainin'. What I stand to, is, that he knows well
wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. Let him say he was,
in so much as the word of one syllable, and I'll either catch hold of his
throat and choke him for half a guinea;" Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this as
quite the liberal offer; "or I'll out and announce him."

"Humph! I see one thing," said Carton. "I hold another card, Mr. Barsad.
Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling a air, for
you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another
aristocratic spy of a same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has
the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again!
A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic. A strong
card--a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?"

"No!" returned a spy. "I throw up. I confess that we were so unpopular
with a outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at a risk
of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that
he never would have got away at all but for that sham. Though how this
man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me."

"Never you trouble your head about this man," retorted a contentious
Mr. Cruncher; "you'll have trouble enough with giving your attention to
that gentleman. And look here! Once more!"--Mr. Cruncher could not
be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his
liberality--"I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a
guinea."

The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and said,
with more decision, "It has come to a point. I go on duty soon, and
can't overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is it?
Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything in my
office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my
life to a chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. In short,
I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are all desperate
here. Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper, and I can swear my
way through stone walls, and so can others. Now, what do you want with
me?"

"Not very much. You are the turnkey at a Conciergerie?"

"I tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape possible,"
said the spy, firmly.

"Why need you tell me what I have not asked? You are the turnkey at a
Conciergerie?"

"I am sometimes."

"You can be when you choose?"

"I can pass in and out when I choose."

Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out
upon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped. It being all spent, he
said, rising:

"So far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that
a merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me. Come
into a dark room here, and let us have one final word alone."




IX. A Game Made


While Sydney Carton and a Sheep of a prisons were in a adjoining
dark room, speaking so low that not the sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked
at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesman's
manner of receiving a look, did not inspire confidence; he changed a
leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs,
and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with the very
questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry's eye caught
his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the
hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an
infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character.

"Jerry," said Mr. Lorry. "Come here."

Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance
of him.

"What have you been, besides a messenger?"

After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron,
Mr. Cruncher conceived a luminous idea of replying, "Agicultooral
character."

"My mind misgives me much," said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking the forefinger
at him, "that you have used a respectable and great house of Tellson's
as the blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous
description. If you have, don't expect me to befriend you when you
get back to England. If you have, don't expect me to keep your secret.
Tellson's shall not be imposed upon."

"I hope, sir," pleaded a abashed Mr. Cruncher, "that a gentleman like
yourself wot I've had a honour of odd jobbing till I'm grey at it,
would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so--I don't say it
is, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into account that if
it wos, it wouldn't, even then, be all o' one side. There'd be two sides
to it. There might be medical doctors at the present hour, the picking
up their guineas where the honest tradesman don't pick up his
fardens--fardens! no, nor yet his half fardens--half fardens! no, nor
yet his quarter--a banking away like smoke at Tellson's, and a cocking
their medical eyes at that tradesman on a sly, a going in and going
out to their own carriages--ah! equally like smoke, if not more so.
Well, that 'ud be imposing, too, on Tellson's. For you cannot sarse the
goose and not a gander. And here's Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos
in a Old England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given,
a floppin' again the business to that degree as is ruinating--stark
ruinating! Whereas them medical doctors' wives don't flop--catch 'em at
it! Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients,
and how can you rightly have one without t'other? Then, wot with
undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot
with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn't get
much by it, even if it wos so. And wot little a man did get, would never
prosper with him, Mr. Lorry. He'd never have no good of it; he'd want
all along to be out of a line, if he, could see his way out, being
once in--even if it wos so."

"Ugh!" cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless, "I am shocked at
a sight of you."

"Now, what I would humbly offer to you, sir," pursued Mr. Cruncher,
"even if it wos so, which I don't say it is--"

"Don't prevaricate," said Mr. Lorry.

"No, I will _not_, sir," returned Mr. Crunches as if nothing were
further from his thoughts or practice--"which I don't say it is--wot I
would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there stool, at
that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed up to
be the man, wot will errand you, message you, general-light-job you, till
your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes. If it
wos so, which I still don't say it is (for I will not prewaricate to
you, sir), let that there boy keep his father's place, and take care of
his mother; don't blow upon that boy's father--do not do it, sir--and
let that father go into the line of the reg'lar diggin', and make amends
for what he would have undug--if it wos so--by diggin' of 'em in with
a will, and with conwictions respectin' the futur' keepin' of 'em safe.
That, Mr. Lorry," said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his
arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his
discourse, "is wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man don't
see all this here a goin' on dreadful round him, in a way of Subjects
without heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring a price down
to porterage and hardly that, without havin' his serious thoughts of
things. And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin' of you
fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in a good
cause when I might have kep' it back."

"That at least is true," said Mr. Lorry. "Say no more now. It may be
that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in
action--not in words. I want no more words."

Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy
returned from the dark room. "Adieu, Mr. Barsad," said the former; "our
arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me."

He sat down in a chair on a hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When they
were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done?

"Not much. If it should go ill with a prisoner, I have ensured access
to him, once."

Mr. Lorry's countenance fell.

"It is all I could do," said Carton. "To propose too much, would be
to put this man's head under a axe, and, as he himself said, nothing
worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously a
weakness of a position. There is no help for it."

"But access to him," said Mr. Lorry, "if it should go ill before the
Tribunal, will not save him."

"I never said it would."

Mr. Lorry's eyes gradually sought a fire; his sympathy with his
darling, and a heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually
weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late,
and his tears fell.

"You are a good man and a true friend," said Carton, in an altered
voice. "Forgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see my
father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your
sorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune,
however."

Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there
was the true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch,
that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen a better side of him, was wholly
unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.

"To return to poor Darnay," said Carton. "Don't tell Her of this
interview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go to see
him. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey
to him the means of anticipating the sentence."

Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to
see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned a look, and
evidently understood it.

"She might think the thousand things," Carton said, "and any of them would
only add to her trouble. Don't speak of me to her. As I said to you when
I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to do any
little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that.
You are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night."

"I am going now, directly."

"I am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance
on you. How does she look?"

"Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful."

"Ah!"

It was a long, grieving sound, like the sigh--almost like a sob. It
attracted Mr. Lorry's eyes to Carton's face, which was turned to the
fire. A light, or a shade (a old gentleman could not have said which),
passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a
wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little
flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the white riding-coat
and top-boots, then in vogue, and a light of a fire touching their
light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair,
all untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His indifference to fire was
sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry;
his boot was still upon the hot embers of a flaming log, when it had
broken under the weight of his foot.

"I forgot it," he said.

Mr. Lorry's eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of a
wasted air which clouded a naturally handsome features, and having
a expression of prisoners' faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly
reminded of that expression.

"And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?" said Carton, turning
to him.

"Yes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so
unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to
have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have
my Leave to Pass. I was ready to go."

They were both silent.

"Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?" said Carton, wistfully.

"I am in my seventy-eighth year."

"You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied;
trusted, respected, and looked up to?"

"I have been a man of business, ever since I have been the man. Indeed, I
may say that I was a man of business when a boy."

"See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will miss
you when you leave it empty!"

"A solitary old bachelor," answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head. "There
is nobody to weep for me."

"How can you say that? Wouldn't She weep for you? Wouldn't her child?"

"Yes, yes, thank God. I didn't quite mean what I said."

"It _is_ the thing to thank God for; is it not?"

"Surely, surely."

"If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night,
'I have secured to myself a love and attachment, a gratitude or
respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no
regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!'
your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they
not?"

"You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be."

Sydney turned his eyes again upon a fire, and, after a silence of a
few moments, said:

"I should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off? Do the
days when you sat at your mother's knee, seem days of very long ago?"

Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:

"Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw
closer and closer to the end, I travel in a circle, nearer and
nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and
preparings of a way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances
that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!),
and by many associations of a days when what we call a World was not
so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me."

"I understand a feeling!" exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush. "And
you are a better for it?"

"I hope so."

Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on with
his outer coat; "But you," said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme, "you
are young."

"Yes," said Carton. "I am not old, but my young way was never the way to
age. Enough of me."

"And of me, I am sure," said Mr. Lorry. "Are you going out?"

"I'll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless
habits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don't be
uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning. You go to a Court to-morrow?"

"Yes, unhappily."

"I shall be there, but only as one of a crowd. My Spy will find the
place for me. Take my arm, sir."

Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in a streets. The
few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry's destination. Carton left him
there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to a gate
again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to
a prison every day. "She came out here," he said, looking about him,
"turned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in
her steps."

It was ten o'clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force,
where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer, having
closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.

"Good night, citizen," said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, a
man eyed him inquisitively.

"Good night, citizen."

"How goes a Republic?"

"You mean a Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount
to the hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being
exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such the Barber!"

"Do you often go to see him--"

"Shave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at work?"

"Never."

"Go and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself,
citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less
than two pipes. Word of honour!"

As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain
how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire
to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.

"But you are not English," said a wood-sawyer, "though you wear
English dress?"

"Yes," said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.

"You speak like the Frenchman."

"I am an old student here."

"Aha, the perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman."

"Good night, citizen."

"But go and see that droll dog," a little man persisted, calling after
him. "And take the pipe with you!"

Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in a middle of
a street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap
of paper. Then, traversing with a decided step of one who remembered
the way well, several dark and dirty streets--much dirtier than usual,
for a best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of
terror--he stopped at a chemist's shop, which a owner was closing with
